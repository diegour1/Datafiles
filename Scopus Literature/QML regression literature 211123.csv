Therefore, it is imperative to develop approaches for detecting Android malware. Recently developed malware detection methods usually rely on various features, such as application programming interface (API) sequences, images, and permissions, thereby ignoring the importance of source code and the associated comments, which are not usually included in malware. Therefore, we propose Android-SEM, which is an Android source code semantic enhancement model based on transfer learning. Our proposed model is built upon the Transformer architecture to achieve a pretraining framework for generating code comments from malware source code. The performance of the pretraining framework is optimized using a generative adversarial network. Our proposed model relies on a novel regression model-based filter to retain high-quality comments and source code for feature fusion pertinent to semantic enhancement. Creatively, and contrary to conventional methods, we incorporated a quantum support vector machine (QSVM) for classifying malicious Android code by combining quantum machine learning and classical deep learning models. The results proved that Android-SEM achieves accuracy levels of 99.55% and 99.01% for malware detection and malware categorization, respectively. © 2022 by the authors.

Similarly, as in other research communities, also in remote sensing (RS), it is not yet defined how its applications can benefit from the usage of quantum computing (QC). This letter proposes a formulation of the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm that can be executed by D-Wave quantum computers. Specifically, the SVR is mapped to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem that is solved with quantum annealing (QA). The algorithm is tested on two different types of computing environments offered by D-Wave: the advantage system, which directly embeds the problem into the quantum processing unit (QPU), and a hybrid solver that employs both classical and QC resources. For the evaluation, we considered a biophysical variable estimation problem with RS data. The experimental results show that the proposed quantum SVR implementation can achieve comparable or, in some cases, better results than the classical implementation. This work is one of the first attempts to provide insight into how QA could be exploited and integrated in future RS workflows based on machine learning (ML) algorithms.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",Quantum annealing (QA); quantum computing (QC); quantum machine learning (QML); remote sensing (RS); support vector regression (SVR),Annealing; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Quantum computers; Remote sensing; Annealing; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Optimisations; Quantum annealing; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Remote-sensing; Support vector regressions; Support vectors machine; algorithm; estimation method; machine learning; optimization; remote sensing; satellite data; support vector machine; Support vector machines,

To address this issue, a highly accurate technique for forecasting wind speed must be developed. In this work, a hybrid classical-quantum model is developed to exploit the advantages of two powerful models, a long short-term memory (LSTM) and a quantum neural network. Quantum neural networks, also known as parameterized quantum circuits, act like machine learning models but with greater expressive power. They comprise quantum gates that apply the principles of quantum mechanics in order to achieve quantum advantage. Additionally, to obtain a robust design that is insensitive to seasonal changes in the data, the Taguchi method is used to set up orthogonal experiments to set the hyperparameters of the proposed model. Historical data from seven sites in various countries (Taiwan, the Philippines, China, and South Korea) are used to forecast 24-hour-ahead wind speeds at the Fuhai wind farm near Taiwan. Comparative simulation results show that the proposed robust hybrid classical-quantum model outperforms current state-of-art models, such as classical nonlinear autoregressive network, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, support vector regression, and classical LSTM. © 2013 IEEE.",Deep learning model; quantum neural network; robust design; wind speed forecasting,Power generation; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Taguchi methods; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Wind speed; Annealing; Computational modelling; Deep learning model; Learning models; Machine-learning; Quantum annealing; Quantum Computing; Quantum neural networks; Robust designs; Wind speed; Wind speed forecasting; Long short-term memory,

With Moore’s law nearing its inevitable end and an ever-increasing demand for large-scale data analysis using machine learning, we must leverage non-conventional computing paradigms like quantum computing to train machine learning models efficiently. Adiabatic quantum computers can approximately solve NP-hard problems, such as the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), faster than classical computers. Since many machine learning problems are also NP-hard, we believe adiabatic quantum computers might be instrumental in training machine learning models efficiently in the post Moore’s law era. In order to solve problems on adiabatic quantum computers, they must be formulated as QUBO problems, which is very challenging. In this paper, we formulate the training problems of three machine learning models—linear regression, support vector machine (SVM) and balanced k-means clustering—as QUBO problems, making them conducive to be trained on adiabatic quantum computers. We also analyze the computational complexities of our formulations and compare them to corresponding state-of-the-art classical approaches. We show that the time and space complexities of our formulations are better (in case of SVM and balanced k-means clustering) or equivalent (in case of linear regression) to their classical counterparts. © 2021, The Author(s).",,,

It is a powerful formalism to represent both the quantum and classical uncertainty of quantum systems and to express different statistical operations such as measurement, system combination and expectations as linear algebra operations. This paper explores how density matrices can be used as a building block for machine learning models exploiting their ability to straightforwardly combine linear algebra and probability. One of the main results of the paper is to show that density matrices coupled with random Fourier features could approximate arbitrary probability distributions over Rn. Based on this finding the paper builds different models for density estimation, classification and regression. These models are differentiable, so it is possible to integrate them with other differentiable components, such as deep learning architectures and to learn their parameters using gradient-based optimization. In addition, the paper presents optimization-less training strategies based on estimation and model averaging. The models are evaluated in benchmark tasks and the results are reported and discussed. © 2022, The Author(s).",Classification; Density estimation; Density matrix; Quantum machine learning; Regression,Deep learning; Learning systems; Probability distributions; Quantum optics; Uncertainty analysis; Density estimation; Density matrix; Machine-learning; Measurement system; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum system; Random features; Regression; Uncertainty; Matrix algebra,

With the proposed framework, the target function is approximated by a mixture of experts model on a low-dimensional manifold, where each cluster is associated with a fixed-degree polynomial. We present a training strategy that leverages the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. During the training, we alternate between (i) applying gradient descent to update the DNN coefficients; and (ii) using closed-form formulae derived from the EM algorithm to update the mixture of experts model parameters. Under the probabilistic formulation, step (ii) admits the form of embarrassingly paralleliazable weighted least-squares solves. The PPOU-Nets consistently outperform the baseline fully-connected neural networks of comparable sizes in numerical experiments of various data dimensions.

Computational methods coupled with global optimization algorithms have been used successfully for this purpose. In this work, we have developed an artificial intelligence method based on active learning (AL) or Bayesian optimization for the automatic structural elucidation of vacancies in solids and nanoparticles. AL uses machine learning regression algorithms and their uncertainties to take decisions (from a policy) on the next unexplored structures to be computed, increasing the probability of finding the global minimum with few calculations. The methodology allows an accurate and automated structural elucidation for vacancies, which are common in non-stoichiometric (berthollide) materials, helping to understand chemical processes in catalysis and environmental sciences, for instance. The AL vacancies method was implemented in the quantum machine learning software/agent for material design and discovery (QMLMaterial). Also, two additional acquisition functions for decision making were implemented, besides the expected improvement (EI): the lower confidence bound (LCB) and the probability of improvement (PI). The new software was applied for the automatic structural search for graphite (C36) with 3 (C36-3) and 4 (C36-4) carbon vacancies and C60 (C60-4) fullerene with 4 carbon vacancies. DFTB calculations were used to build the complex search surfaces with reasonably low computational cost. Furthermore, with the AL method for vacancies, it was possible to elucidate the optimum oxygen vacancy distribution in CaTiO3 perovskite by DFT, where a semiconductor behavior results from oxygen vacancies. Throughout the work, a Gaussian process with its uncertainty was employed in the AL framework using different acquisition functions (EI, LCB and PI), and taking into account different descriptors: Ewald sum matrix and sine matrix. Finally, the performance of the proposed AL method was compared to random search and genetic algorithm. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Carbon; Decision making; Design for testability; Genetic algorithms; Global optimization; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Oxygen vacancies; Perovskite; Structural optimization; Active Learning; Active learning methods; C 60; Carbon vacancy; Expected improvements; Lower confidence bound; matrix; Nonstoichiometric; Structural elucidation; Uncertainty; Nanoparticles,

While decoherence of qubits is expected to decrease the performance of QML models, it is unclear to what extent the diminished performance can be compensated for by adding ancillas to the models and accordingly increasing the virtual bond dimension of the models. We investigate here the competition between decoherence and adding ancillas on the classification performance of two models, with an analysis of the decoherence effect from the perspective of regression. We present numerical evidence that the fully decohered unitary tree tensor network (TTN) with two ancillas performs at least as well as the non-decohered unitary TTN, suggesting that it is beneficial to add at least two ancillas to the unitary TTN regardless of the amount of decoherence may be consequently introduced. © 2023, The Author(s).",Decoherence; Quantum machine learning; Tensor networks,Machine learning; Quantum theory; Qubits; Classification performance; Decoherence; Decoherence effects; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Performance; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Tensor network; Virtual bonds; Tensors,

These transforms appear in many problems related to classification/clustering, regression, system identification, system inversion, and input signal restoration/separation. We here analyze the connections between all these problems in the classical and quantum frameworks. We then focus on their most challenging versions, involving quantum data and/or quantum processing means, and unsupervised, i.e., blind, learning. We consider the general single-preparation quantum information processing (SIPQIP) framework that we have recently proposed. It involves methods that can work with a single instance of each (unknown) state, whereas usual methods are quite cumbersome because they have to very accurately create many copies of each (known) state. In our previous papers, we applied the SIPQIP approach to only one task [blind quantum process tomography (BQPT)], but it opens the way to a large range of other types of methods. In this article, we, therefore, propose various new SIPQIP methods that efficiently perform tasks related to system identification (blind Hamiltonian parameter estimation (BHPE), blind quantum channel identification/estimation, and blind phase estimation), system inversion and state estimation (blind quantum source separation (BQSS), blind quantum entangled state restoration (BQSR), and blind quantum channel equalization), and classification. Numerical tests show that our SIPQIP framework, moreover, yields much more accurate estimation than the usual multiple-preparation approach. Our methods are especially useful in a quantum computer, which we propose to more briefly call a 'quamputer': BQPT and BHPE simplify the characterization of quamputer gates; BQSS and BQSR yield quantum gates that may be used to compensate for the nonidealities that alter states stored in quantum registers and open the way to very general self-adaptive quantum gates. © 2020 IEEE.",Blind Hamiltonian parameter estimation (BHPE); blind quantum process tomography (BQPT); blind quantum source separation (BQSS); blind quantum state restoration (BQSR); blind/unsupervised quantum machine learning; Heisenberg exchange coupling; quantum classification; quantum computer (quamputer); single-preparation quantum information processing (SIPQIP); spin-based qubits,Blind equalization; Blind source separation; Classification (of information); Hamiltonians; Machine learning; Parameter estimation; Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Religious buildings; Restoration; Signal reconstruction; Tomography; Blind hamiltonian parameter estimation; Blind quantum process tomography; Blind quantum source separation; Blind quantum source separations; Blind quantum state restoration; Blind/unsupervised quantum machine learning; Hamiltonian parameters; Heisenberg exchange; Heisenberg exchange coupling; Parameters estimation; Quanta computers; Quantum classification; Quantum computer; Quantum information processing; Quantum process tomography; Quantum state; Single-preparation quantum information processing; Spin-based qubit; State restoration; Quantum optics,

However, due to limited qubits or hardware noise, conducting large-scale experiments often requires significant resources. Moreover, the output of the model is susceptible to corruption by quantum hardware noise. To address this issue, we propose the use of ensemble techniques, which involve constructing a single machine learning model based on multiple instances of quantum neural networks. In particular, we implement bagging and AdaBoost techniques, with different data loading configurations, and evaluate their performance on both synthetic and real-world classification and regression tasks. To assess the potential performance improvement under different environments, we conducted experiments on both simulated, noiseless software and IBM superconducting-based QPUs, suggesting these techniques can mitigate the quantum hardware noise. Additionally, we quantify the amount of resources saved using these ensemble techniques.

The reliable prediction of toxic effects of chemicals in living systems is highly desirable in domains such as cosmetics, drug discovery, food safety, and the manufacturing of chemical compounds. Toxicity prediction requires several new approaches for knowledge discovery from data to paradigm composite associations between the modules of the chemical compound; the computational demands of such techniques increase greatly with the number of chemical compounds involved. State-of-the-art prediction methods such as neural networks and multi-layer regression require either tuning parameters or complex transformations of predictor or outcome variables and do not achieve highly accurate results. This paper proposes a Quantum Inspired Genetic Programming “QIGP” model to improve prediction accuracy. Genetic Programming is utilized to give a linear equation for calculating the degree of toxicity more accurately. Quantum computing is employed to improve the selection of the best-of-run individuals and handles parsimony pressure to reduce the complexity of solutions.

Recent implementations include quantum dot arrays, where the ground state of a multi q-bit system can be altered by voltages applied to the top gates. An extensive investigation concerning the spectra of the many-electron systems under multiple operation conditions set by external voltages typically requires a relatively large number of Hamiltonian diagonalizations, where the Coulomb interaction is considered in an exact manner. Instead of making exhaustive calculations using high throughput computing, we approach this problem by augmenting numerical diagonalizations with machine learning techniques designed to predict the many-electron eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. To this end, we employ and compare the results from linear regression methods such as multivariate least squares (MLS) as well as non-linear techniques based on kernel ridge regression (KRR), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The input feature vectors are assembled from readily available information comprised from a binary representation of the potential and the strength of the Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, employing a linear classifier, we establish a rule for detecting a singlet-Triplet transition which may arise for certain potential configurations.  © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.",exact-diagonalization; machine learning; many-body systems; quantum dots,Computer architecture; Coulomb interactions; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Ground state; Hamiltonians; Learning algorithms; Least squares approximations; Machine learning; Nanocrystals; Neural networks; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Regression analysis; Diagonalizations; Exact diagonalization; Gate arrays; Machine learning techniques; Many electron; Many-body systems; Particle state; Quantum computing architectures; Quantum dot arrays; Quantum dot systems; Semiconductor quantum dots,

In this paper, we present a quantum partial least squares (QPLS) regression algorithm. To solve the high time complexity of the PLS regression, we design a quantum eigenvector search method to speed up principal components and regression parameters construction. Meanwhile, we give a density matrix product method to avoid multiple access to quantum random access memory (QRAM) during building residual matrices.

This paper proposes the use of real superconducting quantum computing devices as the reservoir, where the dissipative property is served by the natural noise added to the quantum bits. The performance of this natural quantum reservoir is demonstrated in a benchmark time-series regression problem and a practical problem classifying different objects based on temporal sensor data. In both cases the proposed reservoir computer shows a higher performance than a linear regression or classification model. The results indicate that a noisy quantum device potentially functions as a reservoir computer, and notably, the quantum noise, which is undesirable in the conventional quantum computation, can be used as a rich computation resource. © 2022, The Author(s).",,,

Here, we present the matrix of orthogonalized atomic orbital coefficients (MAOC) as a quantum-inspired molecular and atomic representation containing both structural (composition and geometry) and electronic (charge and spin multiplicity) information. MAOC is based on a cost-effective localization scheme that represents localized orbitals via a predefined set of atomic orbitals. The latter can be constructed from such small atom-centered basis sets as pcseg-0 and STO-3G in conjunction with guess (non-optimized) electronic configuration of the molecule. Importantly, MAOC is suitable for representing monatomic, molecular, and periodic systems and can distinguish compounds with identical compositions and geometries but distinct charges and spin multiplicities. Using principal component analysis, we constructed a more compact but equally powerful version of MAOC—PCX-MAOC. To test the performance of full and reduced MAOC and several other representations (CM, SOAP, SLATM, and SPAHM), we used a kernel ridge regression machine learning model to predict frontier molecular orbital energy levels and ground state single-point energies for chemically diverse neutral and charged, closed- and open-shell molecules from an extended QM7b dataset, as well as two new datasets, N-HPC-1 (N-heteropolycycles) and REDOX (nitroxyl and phenoxyl radicals, carbonyl, and cyano compounds). MAOC affords accuracy that is either similar or superior to other representations for a range of chemical properties and systems. © 2023 Author(s).",,Atoms; Carbonyl compounds; Chemical bonds; Cost effectiveness; Ground state; Machine learning; Principal component analysis; Regression analysis; Atomic orbital; Coefficient representation; Electronic charges; Electronic spins; Machine-learning; matrix; Quantum machines; Spin multiplicity; Structural composition; Structural geometry; Molecules,

Nonetheless, due to the lack of effective and efficient tools for handling high-dimensional and complex fMRI data, this potential has still not been fully explored. A critical issue to be addressed is to identify clinically relevant features from high dimensional fMRI data in a fast and accurate manner. To address this problem, a new quantum-behaved multiverse optimization (QMVO) approach is proposed for fMRI dimensionality reduction and a new prediction approach based on L1-norm sparse coding and adaptive dictionary learning (SCDL) is developed to decode the whole brain fMRI data. QMVO is designed to enhance local search ability, avoid premature convergence, and increase population diversity among individuals. Further, to efficiently re-estimate parameters of the prediction model with new available data, a new SCDL sparse coding is proposed, which requires no training and needs minimal parameters to tune. The proposed QMVO-SCDL model is applied to a pain-evoked fMRI dataset to decode the pain perception level. Results show that QMVO-SCDL can decode pain levels and identify predictive fMRI patterns with high accuracy, high convergence speed, and short consumption time. Moreover, the performance of the proposed model outperforms different recent ML techniques. Therefore, the proposed model has a great promise to be a powerful tool for fMRI decoding. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Dictionary learning; fMRI; L1-norm basis pursuit; Multiverse optimization; Quantum computing; Sparse coding,Brain; Clinical research; Decoding; Quantum computers; Regression analysis; Adaptive dictionary learning; Basis Pursuits; Dictionary learning; Functional magnetic reasoning imaging; L1 norm; L1-norm base pursuit; Multiverse optimization; Optimisations; Quantum Computing; Sparse coding; Optimization,

To unlock the potential benefits of QC, quantum software development (QSD) enables harnessing its power, further driving innovation across diverse domains. To ensure successful QSD projects, it is crucial to concentrate on key variables. Objective: This study aims to identify key variables in QSD and develop a model for predicting the success probability of QSD projects. Methodology: We identified key QSD variables from existing literature to achieve these objectives and collected expert insights using a survey instrument. We then analyzed these variables using an optimization model, i.e., Genetic Algorithm (GA), with two different prediction methods the Naïve Bayes Classifier (NBC) and Logistic Regression (LR). Results: The results of success probability prediction models indicate that as the QSD process matures, project success probability significantly increases, and costs are notably reduced. Furthermore, the best fitness rankings for each QSD project variable determined using NBC and LR indicated a strong positive correlation (rs=0.945). The t-test results (t = 0.851, p = 0.402>0.05) show no significant differences between the rankings calculated by the two methods (NBC and LR). Conclusion: The results reveal that the developed success probability prediction model, based on 14 identified QSD project variables, highlights the areas where practitioners need to focus more in order to facilitate the cost-effective and successful implementation of QSD projects. © 2023 The Author(s)",Genetic algorithm; Prediction model; Quantum computing (QC); Quantum software development (QSD); Variables,Barium compounds; Cost effectiveness; Forecasting; Genetic programming; Logistic regression; Quantum computers; Software design; Key variables; Logistics regressions; Model-based OPC; Naive Bayes classifiers; Prediction modelling; Quantum Computing; Quantum software development; Software development projects; Variable; Genetic algorithms,

In detail, we design a special feature mapping method to achieve nonlinear transformation of the input data, replacing the hard-to-construct activation function on quantum devices. Considering that the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm is difficult to solve the ELM parameters on near-term quantum devices, we adopt a variational framework to facilitate implementation on the near-term noisy intermediate scale quantum computer. On both classification and regression tasks, our proposed method outperforms classical ELM in classical simulations. Moreover, the classification tasks achieved on IBM quantum simulator also show comparable classification accuracy.

A concrete example toward this goal is the quantum neural network (QNN), which has been developed to accomplish various supervised learning tasks such as classification and regression. However, there are two central issues that remain obscure when QNN is exploited to accomplish classification tasks. First, a quantum classifier that can well balance the computational cost such as the number of measurements and the learning performance is unexplored. Second, it is unclear whether quantum classifiers can be applied to solve certain problems that outperform their classical counterparts. Here we devise a Grover-search based quantum learning scheme (GBLS) to address the above two issues. Notably, most existing QNN-based quantum classifiers can be seamlessly embedded into the proposed scheme. The key insight behind our proposal is reformulating the classification tasks as the search problem. Numerical simulations exhibit that GBLS can achieve comparable performance with other quantum classifiers under various noise settings, while the required number of measurements is dramatically reduced. We further demonstrate a potential quantum advantage of GBLS over classical classifiers in the measure of query complexity.

Traditional machine-learning models struggle with large-scale datasets and complex relationships. This research introduces a novel methodological framework for supply chain backorder prediction, addressing the challenge of collecting large real-world datasets with 90% accuracy. Our proposed model demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting backorders on short and imbalanced datasets. We capture intricate patterns and dependencies by leveraging quantum-inspired techniques within the quantum-classical neural network QAmplifyNet. Experimental evaluations on a benchmark dataset establish QAmplifyNet’s superiority over eight classical models, three classically stacked quantum ensembles, five quantum neural networks, and a deep reinforcement learning model. Its ability to handle short, imbalanced datasets makes it ideal for supply chain management. We evaluate seven preprocessing techniques, selecting the best one based on logistic regression’s performance on each preprocessed dataset. The model’s interpretability is enhanced using Explainable artificial intelligence techniques. Practical implications include improved inventory control, reduced backorders, and enhanced operational efficiency. QAmplifyNet also achieved the highest F1-score of 94% for predicting “Not Backorder” and 75% for predicting “backorder,” outperforming all other models. It also exhibited the highest AUC-ROC score of 79.85%, further validating its superior predictive capabilities. QAmplifyNet seamlessly integrates into real-world supply chain management systems, empowering proactive decision-making and efficient resource allocation. Future work involves exploring additional quantum-inspired techniques, expanding the dataset, and investigating other supply chain applications. This research unlocks the potential of quantum computing in supply chain optimization and paves the way for further exploration of quantum-inspired machine learning models in supply chain management.

The search for ideal QML models is an active research field. This includes identification of efficient classical-to-quantum data encoding scheme, construction of parametric quantum circuits (PQC) with optimal expressivity and entanglement capability, and efficient output decoding scheme to minimize the required number of measurements, to name a few. However, most of the empirical/numerical studies lack a clear path towards scalability. Any potential benefit observed in a simulated environment may diminish in practical applications due to the limitations of noisy quantum hardware (e.g., under decoherence, gate-errors, and crosstalk). We present a scalable quantum-classical hybrid deep neural network (DeepQMLP) architecture inspired by classical deep neural network architectures. In DeepQMLP, stacked shallow Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models mimic the hidden layers of a classical feed-forward multi-layer perceptron network. Each QNN layer produces a new and potentially rich representation of the input data for the next layer. This new representation can be tuned by the parameters of the circuit. Shallow QNN models experience less decoherence, gate errors, etc. which make them (and the network) more resilient to quantum noise. We present numerical studies on a variety of classification problems to show the trainability of DeepQMLP. We also show that DeepQMLP performs reasonably well on unseen data and exhibits greater resilience to noise over QNN models that use a deep quantum circuit. DeepQMLP provided up to 25.3% lower loss and 7.92% higher accuracy during inference under noise than QMLP.  © 2022 IEEE.",n/a,Deep neural networks; Embeddings; Multilayer neural networks; Network architecture; Network layers; Quantum entanglement; Quantum noise; Qubits; Decoherence; Gate errors; Machine-learning; N/a; Neural network architecture; Neural network model; Quantum circuit; Quantum machines; Quantum neural networks; Quantum-classical; Neural network models,"35th International Conference on VLSI Design, VLSID 2022 - held concurrently with 2022 21st International Conference on Embedded Systems, ES 2022"

Many works have examined the behavior of the fall of stock markets and have built models to predict them. Nevertheless, there are limitations to the available research, and the literature calls for more investigation on the topic, as currently the accuracy of the models remains low and they have only been extended for the largest economies. This study provides a comparison of quantum forecast methods and stock market declines and, therefore, a new prediction model of stock market crashes via real-time recession probabilities with the power to accurately estimate future global stock market downturn scenarios is achieved. A 104-country sample has been used, allowing the sample compositions to take into account the regional diversity of the alert warning indicators. To obtain a robust model, several alternative techniques have been employed on the sample under study, being Quantum Boltzmann Machines, which have obtained very good prediction results due to their ability to remember features and develop long-term dependencies from time series and sequential data.

The results suggest that our data encoding enhanced by quantum entanglement provided more expressive power than the previous ones, implying that quantum correlation could be beneficial for the feature map representation of classical data. OurQMLmodels performed significantly better than the multiple linear regression method.

However, higher dimensional quantum systems constitute a promising alternative and are increasingly explored in theory and practice. Here, we explore the capabilities of multi-level quantum systems, so-called qudits, for their use in a quantum machine learning context. We formulate classification and regression problems with the data re-uploading approach and demonstrate that a quantum circuit operating on a single qudit is able to successfully learn highly non-linear decision boundaries of classification problems such as the MNIST digit recognition problem. We demonstrate that the performance strongly depends on the relation between the qudit states representing the labels and the structure of labels in the training data set. Such a bias can lead to substantial performance improvement over qubit-based circuits in cases where the labels, the qudit states, and the operators employed to encode the data are well-aligned. Furthermore, we elucidate the influence of the choice of the elementary operators and show that a squeezing operator is necessary to achieve good performances. We also show that there exists a trade-off for qudit systems between the number of circuit-generating operators in each processing layer and the total number of layers needed to achieve a given accuracy. Finally, we compare classification results from numerically exact simulations and their equivalent implementation on actual IBM quantum hardware.

The primary focus of this domain is the implementation of classical machine learning algorithms in the quantum mechanical domain and study of the speedup due to quantum parallelism, which could enable the development of novel techniques for solving problems such as quantum phase recognition and quantum error correction optimization. In this paper, we propose a hybrid quantum machine learning pipeline for predicting the atomization energies of various molecules using the nuclear charges and atomic positions of the constituent atoms. Firstly, we will be using a deep convolutional auto-encoder model for the feature extraction of data constructed from the eigenvalues and eigenvector centralities of the pairwise distance matrix calculated from atomic positions and the unrolled upper triangle of each Coulomb matrix calculated from nuclear charges, and we will then be using a quantum regression algorithm such as quantum linear regression, quantum radial basis function neural network and, a quantum neural network for estimating the atomization energy. The hybrid quantum neural network models do not seem to provide any speedup over their classical counterparts. Before implementing a quantum algorithm, we will also be using state-of-the-art classical machine learning and deep learning models such as XGBoost, multilayer perceptron, deep convolutional neural network, and a long short-term memory network to study the correlation between the extracted features and corresponding atomization energies of molecules.  © 2021 The Author(s).",Atomization energies; Quantum machine learning; Quantum neural network; Quantum regression model,Atomization; Atoms; Clustering algorithms; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Error correction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Matrix algebra; Molecules; Multilayer neural networks; Quantum computers; Radial basis function networks; Regression analysis; Classical counterpart; Eigenvalues and eigenvector; High dimensional data; Molecular atomization energies; Quantum error corrections; Quantum neural networks; Radial basis function neural networks; Regression algorithms; Quantum theory,

However, modeling these kinds of systems in silico, such as finding the optimum adsorption geometry and energy, is challenging, due to the huge number of possibilities of assembling the adsorbate on the surface. In the current work, we have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) approach based on an active learning (AL) method for adsorption optimization on the surface of materials. AL uses machine learning (ML) regression algorithms and their uncertainties to make a decision (based on a policy) for the next unexplored structures to be computed, increasing, though, the probability of finding the global minimum with a small number of calculations. The methodology allows an accurate and automated structural elucidation of the adsorbate on the surface, based on the minimization of the total electronic energy. The new AL method for adsorption optimization was developed and implemented in the quantum machine learning software/agent for material design and discovery (QMLMaterial) program and was applied for C60@TiO2 anatase (101). It marks another software extension with a new feature in addition to the automatic structural elucidation of defects in materials and of nanoparticles as well. SCC-DFTB calculations were used to build the complex search surfaces with a reasonably low computational cost. An artificial neural network (NN) was employed in the AL framework evaluated together with two uncertainty quantification methods: K-fold cross-validation and non-parametric bootstrap (BS) resampling. Also, two different acquisition functions for decision-making were used: expected improvement (EI) and the lower confidence bound (LCB).

In recent years, the development of quantum computing has made it possible to further reduce the complexity of subspace learning algorithms. Meng et al. pioneered the quantum algorithm for spectral regression (MYXZ algorithm). In this article, the limitations of the MYXZ algorithm are pointed out. We point out that MYXZ algorithm uses sparse Hamiltonian simulation technology to process the matrix generated by the weight matrix, but this matrix is a dense matrix in some cases. In response to this situation, we propose an improved quantum spectral regression algorithm. Our improved algorithm uses quantum singular value estimation technology, which has a polynomial acceleration compared with MYXZ algorithm when dealing with dense matrices. In addition, we propose a new quantum algorithm to accelerate the classical efficient spectral regression. The problems that our new algorithm can handle cannot be handled by MYXZ algorithm.

Machine learning models based on FCHL19 are able to yield predictions of atomic forces and energies of query compounds with chemical accuracy on the scale of milliseconds. FCHL19 is a revision of our previous work [F. A. Faber et al., J. Chem. Phys. 148, 241717 (2018)] where the representation is discretized and the individual features are rigorously optimized using Monte Carlo optimization. Combined with a Gaussian kernel function that incorporates elemental screening, chemical accuracy is reached for energy learning on the QM7b and QM9 datasets after training for minutes and hours, respectively. The model also shows good performance for non-bonded interactions in the condensed phase for a set of water clusters with a mean absolute error (MAE) binding energy error of less than 0.1 kcal/mol/molecule after training on 3200 samples. For force learning on the MD17 dataset, our optimized model similarly displays state-of-the-art accuracy with a regressor based on Gaussian process regression. When the revised FCHL19 representation is combined with the operator quantum machine learning regressor, forces and energies can be predicted in only a few milliseconds per atom. The model presented herein is fast and lightweight enough for use in general chemistry problems as well as molecular dynamics simulations. © 2020 Author(s).",,Atoms; Binding energy; Molecular dynamics; Gaussian kernel functions; Gaussian process regression; Individual features; Machine learning models; Mean absolute error; Molecular dynamics simulations; Monte Carlo optimization; Nonbonded interaction; Machine learning,

Motivated by quantum linear algebra algorithms and the quantum singular value transformation (SVT) framework of Gilyén et al. [STOC'19], we develop classical algorithms for SVT that run in time independent of input dimension, under suitable quantum-inspired sampling assumptions. Our results give compelling evidence that in the corresponding QRAM data structure input model, quantum SVT does not yield exponential quantum speedups. Since the quantum SVT framework generalizes essentially all known techniques for quantum linear algebra, our results, combined with sampling lemmas from previous work, suffices to generalize all recent results about dequantizing quantum machine learning algorithms. In particular, our classical SVT framework recovers and often improves the dequantization results on recommendation systems, principal component analysis, supervised clustering, support vector machines, low-rank regression, and semidefinite program solving. We also give additional dequantization results on low-rank Hamiltonian simulation and discriminant analysis. Our improvements come from identifying the key feature of the quantum-inspired input model that is at the core of all prior quantum-inspired results: g.,""2-norm sampling can approximate matrix products in time independent of their dimension.

These properties can be characterized by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). In this work, we study the experimentally synthesized Co(II) dimer (Co2(C5NH5)4(μ-PO2(CH2C6H5)2)3) SMM with the goal to control the exchange energy, ΔEJ, between the Co atoms through tuning of the capping ligands. The experimentally synthesized Co(II) dimer molecule has a very small ΔEJ < 1 meV. We assemble a DFT data set of 1081 ligand substitutions for the Co(II) dimer. The ligand exchange provides a broad range of exchange energies, ΔEJ, from +50 to -200 meV, with 80% of the ligands yielding a small ΔEJ < 10 meV. We identify descriptors for the classification and regression of ΔEJ using gradient boosting machine learning models. We compare one-hot encoded, structure-based, and chemical descriptors consisting of the HOMO/LUMO energies of the individual ligands and the maximum electronegativity difference and bond order for the ligand atom connecting to Co. We observe a similar overall performance with the chemical descriptors outperforming the other descriptors.

In particular, annealing machines that use the Ising model of statistical mechanics are emerging and feasible next-generation computational technology. Annealing machines can solve combinatorial optimization problems that have been considered difficult to solve in classical computing principles. Currently, Ising-based algorithms are being vigorously developed to perform various applications such as machine learning by solving them as combinatorial optimization problems. On the other hand, the amount of data, such as sensor data and simulation data, used in machine learning applications is drastically increasing. It becomes difficult to handle large amounts of data. In particular, since the number of qubits of annealing machines is limited, Ising-based algorithms independent of data size are strongly required. This paper focuses on Ising-based linear regression that utilizes a precision vector instead of each data element of target data. Although the use of a precision vector is a key point that can reduce the number of qubits against the amount of data, detail such as how many elements of a precision vector is necessary and how these elements are set to be is not clarified yet. This paper discusses the characteristics of a precision vector through performance evaluation of Ising-based linear regression with a practical data set in empirical ways.

We present an efficient approach to produce high quality QC data sets for applications in cluster formation studies and how to train an accurate quantum machine learning model on the generated data. Using the two-component sulfuric acid-water system as a proof of concept, we demonstrate that a kernel ridge regression machine learning model with Δ-learning can be trained to accurately predict the binding energies of cluster equilibrium configurations with mean absolute errors below 0.5 kcal mol-1. Additionally, we enlarge the training data set with nonequilibrium configurations and show the possibility of predicting the binding energies of new structures of clusters several molecules larger than those in the training set. Applying the trained machine learning model leads to a drastic reduction in the number of relevant clusters that need to be explicitly evaluated by QC methods.

Mobile users' trajectories prediction belongs to the task of temporal information processing, and it is a mobility management problem that is essential for self-organising and autonomous 6G networks. Our aim is to accurately predict the future positions of mobile users in wireless networks using QRC. To do so, the authors use a real-world time series dataset to model mobile users' trajectories. The QRC approach has two components: reservoir computing (RC) and quantum computing (QC). In RC, the training is more computational-efficient than the training of simple recurrent neural networks since, in RC, only the weights of the output layer are trainable. The internal part of RC is what is called the reservoir. For the RC to perform well, the weights of the reservoir should be chosen carefully to create highly complex and non-linear dynamics. The QC is used to create such dynamical reservoir that maps the input time series into higher dimensional computational space composed of dynamical states. After obtaining the high-dimensional dynamical states, a simple linear regression is performed to train the output weights and, thus, the prediction of the mobile users' trajectories can be performed efficiently. In this study, we apply a QRC approach based on the Hamiltonian time evolution of a quantum system. The authors simulate the time evolution using IBM gate-based quantum computers, and they show in the experimental results that the use of QRC to predict the mobile users' trajectories with only a few qubits is efficient and can outperform the classical approaches such as the long short-term memory approach and the echo-state networks approach. © 2023 The Authors.

In order to make up for this deficiency, this paper proposes a quantum fuzzy regression model, which uses fuzzy theory to describe the uncertainty in big data sets and uses quantum computing to exponentially improve the efficiency of data set preprocessing and parameter estimation. In this paper, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to calculate the degree of importance of each data point. Meanwhile, Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd (HHL) algorithm and quantum swap circuits are used to improve the efficiency of high-dimensional data matrix calculation. The application of the quantum fuzzy regression model to small-scale financial data proves that its accuracy is greatly improved compared with the quantum regression model. Moreover, due to the introduction of quantum computing, the speed of dealing with high-dimensional data matrix has an exponential improvement compared with the fuzzy regression model. The quantum fuzzy regression model proposed in this paper combines the advantages of fuzzy theory and quantum computing which can efficiently calculate high-dimensional data matrix and complete parameter estimation using quantum computing while retaining the uncertainty in big data.

Furthermore, we have not only fitted the characteristic I-V curve but also evaluated three classical algorithms; K-Nearest Neighbour, Artificial Neural Network, and Genetic Programming besides using a Quantum Neural Network to predict the behavior of the device. The models have achieved outstanding results and managed to capture the trend of the target values. The Quantum Neural Network has been used for the first time to model the photodiode characteristics. The trained models are of great significance since they can be used to reduce the characterization and measurement times. © 2021 The Authors",Organic Semiconductors – Heterojunction Photodiode – Machine Learning – Genetic Programming – Quantum Machine Learning,Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Heterojunctions; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Organic semiconductor materials; Regression analysis; Artificial intelligence techniques; Higher efficiency; Machine learning techniques; Organic semiconductor – heterojunction photodiode – machine learning – genetic programming – quantum machine learning; Organic/inorganic heterojunctions; Performance; Quantum neural networks; Responsivity; Technological applications; UV photodiodes; Photodiodes,

But it has been computationally hard to sample random features according to a probability distribution that is optimized for the data, so as to minimize the required number of features for achieving the learning to a desired accuracy. Here, we develop a quantum algorithm for sampling from this optimized distribution over features, in runtime O(D) that is linear in the dimension D of the input data. Our algorithm achieves an exponential speedup in D compared to any known classical algorithm for this sampling task. In contrast to existing quantum machine learning algorithms, our algorithm circumvents sparsity and low-rank assumptions and thus has wide applicability. We also show that the sampled features can be combined with regression by stochastic gradient descent to achieve the learning without canceling out our exponential speedup. Our algorithm based on sampling optimized random features leads to an accelerated framework for machine learning that takes advantage of quantum computers. © 2020 Neural information processing systems foundation.

Airline companies are changing tickets' prices very often considering a variety of factors based on their proprietary rules and algorithms that are searching for the most suitable price policy. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are exploited for the latter task, due to their compactness, fast adaptability, and many potentials in data generalization. This paper represents an analysis of airfare price prediction towards finding similarities in the pricing policies of different Airline companies by using AI Techniques. More specifically, a set of effective features is extracted from 136.917 data flights of Aegean, Turkish, Austrian and Lufthansa Airlines for six popular international destinations. The extracted set of features is then used to conduct a holistic analysis from the perspective of the end user who seeks the most affordable ticket cost, considering a destination-based evaluation including all airlines, and an airline-based evaluation including all destinations. For the latter cause, AI models from three different domains and a total of 16 model architectures are considered to resolve the airfare price prediction problem: Machine Learning (ML) with eight state-of-the-art models, Deep Learning (DL) with six CNN models and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) with two models. Experimental results reveal that at least three models from each domain, ML, DL, and QML, are able to achieve accuracies between 89% and 99% in this regression problem, for different international destinations and airline companies.  © 2013 IEEE.",Airfare price; artificial intelligence; deep learning; machine learning; prediction model; pricing models; quantum machine learning; regression,Air transportation; Cost benefit analysis; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Operating costs; Quantum theory; Airfare price; Airline industry; Atmospheric modeling; Deep learning; Features extraction; Machine-learning; Prediction algorithms; Prediction modelling; Predictive models; Pricing models; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Regression; Forecasting,

We thus propose a correction method using learning-based error mitigation for hybrid quantum-classical machine learning, which can be used by experimenters without prior knowledge of the quantum noise channel models. A correction function using linear regression models inspired by the depolarizing noise channel is trained, and the function is to correct classical probabilities of each qubit of the quantum circuit for the quantum machine learning model. In constructing the training data for the correction function, we assume that quantum circuit simulators yield classical probabilities with the noise-free state as the ground truth. In the experiments, quantum generative models, quantum neural networks, and quantum circuit learning models were used for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method on noisy quantum devices (simulation models) and real devices.

Researchers have formulated and executed a plethora of bug forecasting methodologies by computing the performance in terms of precision and difficulty. Various statistical models are established in the literature to observe bug existence and restoring method; these models are termed software reliability growth models. The existence of bugs in software is primarily because of the constant variations in the software code. Open source software is prevalent amongst academicians and has found users in big businesses. OSS is extremely effective, but source code variations have to be made regularly through the progressively advanced requirement at the user’s end. The open source group is expanding rapidly, and numerous categories of provisions are offered. Stakeholders contribute to OSS in business by reinforcing the value of schemes, taking into account great revenue earnings and novel scheme expansion. An essential feature of open source software is determining when to issue a novel form. The principal goal is to announce the software at a suitable time with minimal economic restrictions. The approach after announcing software is a challenge and announcement development performs a vital function in handling effective announcements to clients. It is essentially a group of novel characteristics that are combined to form an invention setting. The primary announcement is just after the expansion procedure and additional consequent announcements are founded upon the preceding announcements, number of prerequisites, and faults restored. Each announcement incorporates a collection of characteristics fulfilling particular restrictions of the corporation as required by the customers. Forming conclusions about what characteristics are to be encompassed in which announcement is a tiresome job. Information theory, which deals with computation and communication of knowledge around a network, was primarily invented by Claude E Shannon. It is a probabilistic established method that emphasizes the computation of vagueness associating data. It has widespread prospective functions in areas including model recognition, statistical interpretation, natural language processing, thermal physics, quantum computing, etc. Entropy is a significant subdivision of information theory that performs a principal function in examining the code change procedure. It is a quantity of uncertainty/difficulty of code change and portrays the quantity of information covered in an event. In this chapter, a method of captivating the number of faults documented in numerous announcements of Bugzilla software is established and distinctive amounts of entropy for the alterations in various software, which informs these intervals, are computed. Initially simple linear regression is employed to envisage faults that are expected to occur in the future. By means of anticipated faults and entropy measures in multiple linear regression, the announcement period of the software has been forecast. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

We provide a first evaluation on the performance of these classifiers when using a hyperparameter search on six widely known and publicly available benchmark datasets and analyze how their performance varies with the number of samples on two artificially generated test classification datasets. As quantum machine learning is based on unitary transformations, this paper explores data structures and application fields that could be particularly suitable for quantum advantages. Hereby, this paper introduces a novel dataset based on concepts from quantum mechanics using the exponential map of a Lie algebra. This dataset will be made publicly available and contributes a novel contribution to the empirical evaluation of quantum supremacy. We further compared the performance of VQC and QKE on six widely applicable datasets to contextualize our results. Our results demonstrate that the VQC and QKE perform better than basic machine learning algorithms, such as advanced linear regression models (Ridge and Lasso). They do not match the accuracy and runtime performance of sophisticated modern boosting classifiers such as XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost. Therefore, we conclude that while quantum machine learning algorithms have the potential to surpass classical machine learning methods in the future, especially when physical quantum infrastructure becomes widely available, they currently lag behind classical approaches. Our investigations also show that classical machine learning approaches have superior performance classifying datasets based on group structures, compared to quantum approaches that particularly use unitary processes. Furthermore, our findings highlight the significant impact of different quantum simulators, feature maps, and quantum circuits on the performance of the employed quantum estimators. This observation emphasizes the need for researchers to provide detailed explanations of their hyperparameter choices for quantum machine learning algorithms, as this aspect is currently overlooked in many studies within the field.

Model training can be viewed as a form of optimization used to fit a machine learning model to a set of data, which can take up significant amount of time on classical computers. Adiabatic quantum computers have been shown to excel at solving optimization problems, and therefore, we believe, present a promising alternative to improve machine learning training times. In this paper, we present an adiabatic quantum computing approach for training a linear regression model. In order to do this, we formulate the regression problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. We analyze our quantum approach theoretically, test it on the D-Wave adiabatic quantum computer and compare its performance to a classical approach that uses the Scikit-learn library in Python. Our analysis shows that the quantum approach attains up to 2.8 × speedup over the classical approach on larger datasets, and performs at par with the classical approach on the regression error metric. The quantum approach used the D-Wave 2000Q adiabatic quantum computer, whereas the classical approach used a desktop workstation with an 8-core Intel i9 processor.

The convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models transformed the OCL problems into a regression task. However, the abundant semantic information of the crowd scenes may lead the CNN framework hard to extract adequate features in order to ensure good precision In this work, a Quantum Image Feature Extraction with Dense Distribution-Aware Learning (QE-DAL) framework was proposed to handle this problem. The crowd features were extracted by Quantum layers, which were extracted by encoding, quantum circuits and decode procedures based on the multi-scale architecture. For handling objects, the refined distance compensating operator was adopted to fuse the multi-scale architecture. To relieve the computation burden, a Gaussian distribution estimation mechanism was proposed to initiate and update the bounding sizes of the objects via a point-supervised manner. Finally, the joint loss function, which describes pixel classes, density maps and offset bounding boxes, was built for QE-DAL. The ablation experiment results demonstrated that the effectiveness of the quantum feature extraction architecture and the Gaussian distribution estimation mechanism of QE-DAL was validated to show superior performance than the other state-of-the-art framework.

In this paper, we propose a gradient descent-based backpropagation algorithm that can efficiently calculate the gradient in parameter optimization and update the parameter for quantum circuit learning, which outperforms the current parameter search algorithms in terms of computing speed while presenting the same or even higher test accuracy. Meanwhile, the proposed theoretical scheme was successfully implemented on the 20-qubit quantum computer of IBM Q, ibmq_johannesburg. The experimental results reveal that the gate error, especially the CNOT gate error, strongly affects the derived gradient accuracy. The regression accuracy performed on the IBM Q becomes lower with the increase in the number of measurement shot times due to the accumulated gate noise error. © 2021 by the authors.

A carefully constructed representation can lower the prediction error for out-of-sample data by several orders of magnitude with the same training data. This is a particularly desirable effect in data scarce scenarios, such as they are common in first principles based chemical compound space explorations. Unfortunately, representations which result in KRR models with low and steep learning curves for extensive properties, for example, energies, do not necessarily lead to well performing models for response properties. In this chapter we review the recently introduced FCHL18 representation (Faber et al., J Chem Phys 148(24):241717, 2018), in combination with kernel-based QML models to account for response properties by including the corresponding operators in the regression (Christensen et al., J Chem Phys 150(6):064105, 2019). FCHL18 was designed to describe an atom in its chemical environment, allowing to measure distances between elements in the periodic table, and consequently providing a metric for both structural and chemical similarities between compounds. The representation does not decouple the radial and angular degrees of freedom, which makes it well-suited for comparing atomic environments. QML models using FCHL18 display low and steep learning curves for energies of molecules, clusters, and crystals. By contrast, the same QML models exhibit less favorable learning for other properties, such as forces, electronic eigenvalues, or dipole moments. We discuss the use of the electric field differential operator within a kernel-based operator QML (OQML) approach. Using OQML results in the same predictive accuracy for molecular dipole norm, but with approximately 20× less training data, as directly learning the dipole norm with a KRR model. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,

Guan Y.-H.,The effects of phonological recoding on taiwanese students’ reading processes: Evidence from eye tracking experiments,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111354698&doi=10.6251%2fBEP.202012_52%282%29.0010&partnerID=40&md5=6385f554f97df638491b23af99fd3bb2,"Phonological recoding is a psychological process in which readers convert printed words into sounds (i.e., phonological codes) during silent reading. The role of phonological recoding in reading has long been debated in the field of psycholinguistics. Most relevant studies have mainly focused on examining the role of phonological recoding in word recognition. Three major theoretical approaches have been proposed for lexical access. First, the phonological mediation model assumes that the meaning of a word is accessed through its phonology; that is, the sequence of the word recognition process is orthography phonology semantics. Phonological recoding of a word occurs prior to the access of its meaning (Lukatela & Turvey, 1994; Rayner, Pollatsek, & Binder, 1998; Van Orden, Johnston, & Hale, 1988). Second, the direct access route model assumes that the meaning of a word can be directly accessed through the transition from orthography to semantics without the mediation of phonology (M. Coltheart & Coltheart, 1997; Taft & Van Graan, 1998). The model, however, does not deny the possibility of phonological activation. Rather, it assumes that phonological recoding occurs concurrently to or later than the access of the word’s meaning. Third, the dual route model suggests that two parallel running routes can achieve lexical access: one is the phonologically mediated route, and the other is the direct access route (M. Coltheart, 2000). The route that achieves lexical access depends on the route that runs the fastest (Barron, 1986; Paap, Noel, & Johansen, 1992). McCusker, Hillinger, and Bias (1981) indicated that the difficulty of material, subjects’ reading fluency, the frequency of occurrence of items, and task demands can determine the use of phonological recoding. Chinese is a logographic language and is also regarded as a phonologically opaque one. Nevertheless, studies investigating the time course of phonological activation in Chinese word recognition have yielded inconsistent results. Although some evidence has suggested that phonology can be activated very early in the word recognition process when Chinese readers read Chinese words or sentences (Guo, Peng, & Liu, 2005; Tan, Hoosain, & Peng, 1995; Zhang & Perfetti, 1993), it remains controversial whether phonological recoding plays a crucial role in word recognition and text comprehension. Few studies have measured Chinese subjects’ reading comprehension under the condition of articulatory suppression, which has been proven to interfere with phonological recoding (Lu & Zhang, 2007; Ding & Wang, 2006). However, the results of such studies have been inconsistent, and whether phonological recoding is important for Chinese text comprehension remains unclear. This study conducted two eye-tracking experiments by using the same experimental paradigm implemented by Guan (2015, 2020) to investigate whether adult Chinese readers need to rely on phonological recoding to understand short expository texts and also whether readers without the background knowledge relevant to domain-specific texts must rely more on phonological recoding to comprehend them. In Experiment 1, 30 university students in Taipei were recruited whose mother tongue was Mandarin Chinese. They were asked to read 20 short expository texts (each one was 350 characters in length) under five different reading conditions: articulatory suppression, reading aloud, concurrent reading and listening to an irrelevant text (IRS), reading while listening to the same text (RWL), and silent reading. The topics of the texts included, for example, “advice for new graduates when entering workforce,” “the impact of 3C products on human cognition,” “water pollution,” “the color of eggs,” “the crisis of water resources,” “the function of sun light,” “the philosopher and the frog,” “Mr. thought,” “experiment with monkeys,” “the stereotypes of teachers in Taiwan,” and “the influences of watching TV on small children.” Subjects’ reading time and comprehension score for each text as well as their eye movements were recorded, which were then analyzed by several linear or generalized linear mixed models to find the best fitting model for each dependent variable. The results revealed that articulatory suppression significantly impaired reading comprehension and caused a larger regression ratio in text reading as well as a higher rereading rate on target words, whereas the effects of the other reading conditions on comprehension did not differ from each other. These results suggest that phonological recoding is essential for Chinese expository text comprehension and word recognition. Reading aloud, compared with silent reading, significantly increased the overall reading time, mean fixation duration, and number of fixations in a text but substantially reduced the mean saccade length and regression ratio. In word-level processing, reading aloud led to a much longer first fixation duration, gaze duration, rereading time, and total reading time on target words selected in the texts. Through word-by-word reading, reading aloud seemed to facilitate integrated sentence meaning, but it failed to significantly enhance overall reading comprehension. Moreover, RWL caused higher rereading rates on target words than did silent reading, and it did not improve reading comprehension. In line with results found under the reading aloud condition, the null effects of reading aloud and RWL on reading comprehension could indicate that both reading conditions make the covert phonological recoding during silent reading overt and therefore imposed similar effects on reading comprehension to those exerted by the phonological recoding in silent reading. Experiment 2 was conducted to further examine whether subjects’ background knowledge regarding the text content would moderate their reliance on phonological recoding in understanding domain-specific texts, such that subjects without much background knowledge would rely more on phonological recoding in the processing of unfamiliar terms and text content. To this end, 15 excerpts from journal articles in Scientific American were used as experimental materials. The topics of these texts were all about physics, such as the Higgs boson, quantum computing, loop quantum gravity, antimatter, charge-coupled devices, and 3He superfluid. The same experimental paradigm as in Experiment 1 was used in Experiment 2, and a different sample of 30 university students in Taipei were recruited as participants. Half majored in humanities and social sciences and had no background knowledge in physics. The other half of the students majored in natural sciences, such as physics, atmospheric physics, and materials science; therefore, they had background knowledge in physics. Participants were asked to read the texts and answer four comprehension questions after reading each text. The results revealed that only background knowledge had a significant effect on reading comprehension, whereas reading conditions and their interaction with background knowledge did not exhibit any significant effects. Participants with relevant background knowledge performed significantly better than did their counterparts. However, background knowledge did not moderate participants’ dependency on phonological recoding in reading comprehension. It seems that phonological recoding did not play a crucial role in understanding short domain-specific texts. Analysis of participants’ eye movements indicated that reading aloud could slow their reading speed and reduce their regression ratio, but it did not enhance reading comprehension. RWL increased the rereading rate on target words in short expository texts, and it increased reading time and the mean fixation duration in domain specific texts. IRS did not affect comprehension performance; it only increased the rereading rate on domain-specific target words and prolonged the first fixation duration for participants without relevant background knowledge. In sum, the results of this study suggest that phonological recoding provides critical support for Chinese adult readers to comprehend short expository texts, but it only plays a minor role in understanding domain-specific texts. When participants read domain-specific texts, it was their background knowledge that dominated their reading comprehension performance. © 2020, National Taiwan Normal University.

Variational methods that use quantum resources of imperfect quantum devices with the help of classical computing techniques are popular for supervised learning. Variational Quantum Classification (VQC) is one of such variational methods with possible quantum advantage in using quantum-enhanced features that are hard to compute by classical methods. Its performance depends on the mapping of classical features into quantum-enhanced feature space. Although there have been many quantum-mapping functions proposed so far, there is little discussion on efficient mapping of discrete features, such as, race, gender, marriage status and others that are often significant for classifying datasets of interest. We first introduce the use of Quantum Random Access Coding (QRAC) to map such discrete features efficiently into limited number of qubits for VQC. We numerically show that QRAC can help speeding up the training of VQC by reducing its parameters via reduction on the number of qubits for the mapping. We confirm the effectiveness of the QRAC in VQC by experimenting on classification of healthcare datasets with both simulators and real quantum devices. © 2020 IEEE.",discrete features; quantum machine learning; quantum random access coding; supervised learning; variational quantum algorithms,Learning systems; Mapping; Quantum theory; Qubits; Signal encoding; Variational techniques; Classical computing; Classical methods; Feature space; Mapping functions; Quantum device; Quantum resources; Random access; Variational methods; Classification (of information),"2020 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2020"

First, we introduce a combined density matrix representation method that transforms CCA into generalized eigenvalue decomposition. Moreover, to address the challenge of performing generalized eigenvalue decomposition in high-dimensional scenarios, we propose a quantum method for extracting the canonical principal axes. In this method, two sets of variables are transformed into a reduced density matrix, so that the product of variable matrices can be accelerated by phase estimation and controlled rotation. Complexity analysis shows that the QCCA algorithm achieves exponential acceleration in variable dimensions n, p and variable size m compared to classical algorithms. The QCCA algorithm serves as a foundation for the subsequent development of quantum algorithms for classification, regression, and other machine learning tasks.  © 2023 Astro Ltd.",quantum algorithm; quantum canonical correlation analysis (QCCA); quantum machine learning,,

However, finding the optimum structures is a bottleneck due to the huge search space, and global search algorithms have been used successfully for this purpose. In this work, we present the quantum machine learning software/agent for materials design and discovery (QMLMaterial), intended for automatic structural determination in silico for several chemical systems: atomic clusters, atomic clusters and the spin multiplicity together, doping in clusters or solids, vacancies in clusters or solids, adsorption of molecules or adsorbents on surfaces, and finally atomic clusters on solid surfaces/materials or encapsulated in porous materials. QMLMaterial is an artificial intelligence (AI) software based on the active learning method, which uses machine learning regression algorithms and their uncertainties for decision making on the next unexplored structures to be computed, increasing the probability of finding the global minimum with few calculations as more data is obtained. The software has different acquisition functions for decision making (e.g., expected improvement and lower confidence bound). Also, the Gaussian process is available in the AI framework for regression, where the uncertainty is obtained analytically from Bayesian statistics. For the artificial neural network and support vector regressor algorithms, the uncertainty can be obtained by K-fold cross-validation or nonparametric bootstrap resampling methods. The software is interfaced with several quantum chemistry codes and atomic descriptors, such as the many-body tensor representation.

Existing quantum algorithms have demonstrated the potential for large speedups, but the required quantum resources are not immediately available on near-term quantum devices. In this work, we study near-term quantum algorithms for linear systems of equations, with a focus on the two-norm and Tikhonov regression settings. We investigate the use of variational algorithms and analyze their optimization landscapes. There exist types of linear systems for which variational algorithms designed to avoid barren plateaus, such as properly-initialized imaginary time evolution and adiabatic-inspired optimization, suffer from a different plateau problem. To circumvent this issue, we design near-term algorithms based on a core idea: the classical combination of variational quantum states (CQS). We exhibit several provable guarantees for these algorithms, supported by the representation of the linear system on a so-called ansatz tree. The CQS approach and the ansatz tree also admit the systematic application of heuristic approaches, including a gradient-based search. We have conducted numerical experiments solving linear systems as large as 2300 × 2300 by considering cases where we can simulate the quantum algorithm efficiently on a classical computer.

In many real world problems, its beneficial to perform sparse linear regression to identify important features helpful in predicting the dependent variable. It not only helps in getting interpretable results but also avoids overfitting when the number of features is large, and the amount of data is small. The most natural way to achieve this is by using ‘best subset selection’ which penalizes non-zero model parameters by adding ℓ0 norm over parameters to the least squares loss. However, this makes the objective function non-convex and intractable even for a small number of features. This paper aims to address the intractability of sparse linear regression with ℓ0 norm using adiabatic quantum computing, a quantum computing paradigm that is particularly useful for solving optimization problems faster.

As a result, the literature has spent a considerable effort in designing representations that capture basic physical properties. Our work focuses on the less-studied learning formulations in this context in order to exploit inner structures in the prediction errors. In particular, we propose to directly optimize basic loss functions of the prediction error metrics typically used in the literature, such as the mean absolute error or the worst case error. In some instances, a proper choice of the loss function can directly reduce reasonably the prediction performance in the desired metric, albeit at the cost of additional computations during training.

The representation is based on Gaussian distribution functions, scaled by power laws and explicitly accounting for structural as well as elemental degrees of freedom. The elemental components help us to lower the QML model's learning curve, and, through interpolation across the periodic table, even enable ""alchemical extrapolation"" to covalent bonding between elements not part of training. This point is demonstrated for the prediction of covalent binding in single, double, and triple bonds among main-group elements as well as for atomization energies in organic molecules. We present numerical evidence that resulting QML energy models, after training on a few thousand random training instances, reach chemical accuracy for out-of-sample compounds. Compound datasets studied include thousands of structurally and compositionally diverse organic molecules, non-covalently bonded protein side-chains, (H2O)40-clusters, and crystalline solids.

In actual operation, batteries are seldom fully discharged. For a constant current-constant voltage charging mode, the incomplete discharging process affects not only the initial state but also processed variables of the subsequent charging profile, thereby mainly limiting the applications of many feature-based capacity estimation methods which rely on a whole cycling process. Since the charging information of the constant voltage profile can be completely saved whether the battery is fully discharged or not, a geometrical feature of the constant voltage charging profile is extracted to be a new aging feature of lithium-ion batteries under the incomplete discharging situation in this work. By introducing the quantum computing theory into the classical machine learning technique, an integrated quantum particle swarm optimization–based support vector regression estimation framework, as well as its application to characterize the relationship between extracted feature and battery remaining capacity, are presented and illustrated in detail. With the lithium-ion battery data provided by NASA, experiment and comparison results demonstrate the effectiveness, accuracy, and superiority of the proposed battery capacity estimation framework for the not entirely discharged condition. © 2018 Wang et al.

The support vector regression (SVR) model can be hybridized with novel meta-heuristic algorithms not only to identify fluctuations and the nonlinear tendencies of electric loads, but also to generate satisfactory forecasts. However, many such algorithms have numerous drawbacks, such as a low population diversity and trapping at local optima, which are problems of premature convergence. Accordingly, approaches to increase the accuracy of forecasting must be developed. In this investigation, quantum computing mechanism is used to quantamize dragonfly behaviors to enhance the searching effectiveness of the dragonfly algorithm, namely QDA. In addition, conducting the data preprocessing by the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) is useful to improve the forecasting accuracy. Thus, a new electric load forecasting model, the CEEMDAN-SVRQDA model, that combines the CEEMDAN and hybridizes the QDA with an SVR model, is proposed to provide more accurate forecasts.

However, to date, the compaction quality assessment model has not been accurate enough, and no effective feedback control measures have been developed. Hybrid data mining algorithms have great potential for solving this problem. In this study, smart bacteria-foraging algorithm-based customized kernel support vector regression (SBFA-CKSVR) is proposed for compaction quality assessment, whereas an enhanced probabilistic neural network (EPNN) is adopted for compaction quality control. SBFA integrates a bacteria-foraging algorithm, chaos mapping, and adaptive and quantum computing to solve the high-dimensional complex problem effectively. CKSVR is proposed to approximate a function in quadratic continuous integral space L2(R) where its hyperparameters are optimized by SBFA. Finally, SBFA-CKSVR is used to establish a high-precision compaction quality assessment model whereas the EPNN is adopted to realize the compaction quality feedback control. A three-dimensional real-time monitoring system for the earth-rock dam is also developed based on SBFA-CKSVR and EPNN.

The reliable prediction of toxic effects of chemicals in living systems is highly desirable in domains such as cosmetics, drug design, food safety, and the manufacturing of chemical compounds. Toxicity prediction requires several new approaches for knowledge discovery from data to paradigm composite associations between the modules of the chemical compound; the computational demands of such techniques increase greatly with the number of chemical compounds involved. State-of-the-art prediction methods such as neural networks and multilayer regression require either tuning parameters or complex transformations of predictor or outcome variables and do not achieve highly accurate results. This paper proposes a quantum-inspired genetic programming model to improve prediction accuracy. Genetic programming is utilized to give a linear equation for calculating the degree of toxicity more accurately. Quantum computing is employed to improve the selection of the best-of-run individuals and handles parsimony pressure to reduce the complexity of solutions.

Quantum evolutionary computing is a relatively recent spot-lighted concept which takes advantage from both the evolutionary and quantum computing laws. In general, QIEAs have been proven to be really powerful for optimising complex engineering tasks. The fascinating trait of observation operator in QIEA enables us to transform the quantum bits to both the binary and continuous spaces. Here, the authors present a mix continuous/binary version of QIEA, to find out whether it is suited for designing regularised EELMs. Indeed, the design process of EELM is conducted at two different levels, i.e. hyper and low levels. At the low level, some novel criteria are presented in the form of penalty functions to enable the optimiser searching for parsimonious, compact and accurate regularised extreme learning machines, as individual components of the ensemble. At the hyper-level, the non-negative least square error optimisation technique is utilised to deterministically find the most eligible components for designing the ensemble.

It often serves as a preprocessing step to surmount the curse of dimensionality and to gain efficiency, and thus it plays an important role in machine learning and data mining. In this paper, we present a quantum algorithm that compresses an exponentially large high-dimensional but approximately low-rank dataset in quantum parallel, by dimensionality reduction (DR) based on principal component analysis (PCA), the most popular classical DR algorithm. We show that the proposed algorithm has a runtime polylogarithmic in the dataset’s size and dimensionality, which is exponentially faster than the classical PCA algorithm, when the original dataset is projected onto a polylogarithmically low-dimensional space. The compressed dataset can then be further processed to implement other tasks of interest, with significantly less quantum resources. As examples, we apply this algorithm to reduce data dimensionality for two important quantum machine learning algorithms, quantum support vector machine and quantum linear regression for prediction.

It is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with various applications in human-computer interaction, security and surveillance, robot perception, traffic control, etc. In this paper, we address this problem in the quantum setting, and present a quantum algorithm for VT based on the framework proposed by Henriques et al. [IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell. 7, 583 (2015)ITPIDJ0162-882810.1109/TPAMI.2014.2345390]. Our algorithm comprises two phases: training and detection. In the training phase, in order to discriminate the object and background, the algorithm trains a ridge regression classifier in the quantum state form where the optimal fitting parameters of ridge regression are encoded in the amplitudes. In the detection phase, the classifier is then employed to generate a quantum state whose amplitudes encode the responses of all the candidate image patches. The algorithm is shown to be polylogarithmic in scaling, when the image data matrices have low condition numbers, and therefore may achieve exponential speedup over the best classical counterpart. However, only quadratic speedup can be achieved when the algorithm is applied to implement the ultimate task of Henriques's framework, i.e., detecting the object position.

The approach should be of widespread utility in continuous wave magnetic resonance experiments of all kinds. We utilize adaptive signal averaging to expedite the averaging process usually performed in magnetic resonance experiments. We were capable of reducing the noise variance in a single trace by a factor of 11.3 which is equivalent to reduction in time by the same factor. This factor can be quite significant especially when signal averaging must be performed over the span of many hours to days. This technique may also be tailored to conventional electron spin resonance experiments and other techniques where signal averaging is utilized. The approach may offer promise in the eventual development of spin based quantum computing. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Inspired by the conventional FLN and quantum mechanics, this work proposes a kind of quantum-inspired double parallel feed-forward neural network (QIDPFNN). Compared with the FLN, the proposed algorithm presents two obvious differentials. Firstly, the input weights between hidden layer and input layer are generated by quantum computing. Secondly, a new hidden layer activation function is introduced. In order to verify the QIDPFNN validity, it is applied to 13 regression applications. The experimental results show that the QIDPFNN owns better generalization ability and stronger stability than FLN on most applications. Simultaneously, the QIDPFNN is applied to build NOx emission concentration model and thermal efficiency model of a 330 MW circulating fluidized bed boiler.

These human-competitive results come from a wide variety of fields, including quantum computing circuits, analog electrical circuits, antennas, mechanical systems, controllers, game playing, finite algebras, photonic systems, image recognition, optical lens systems, mathematical algorithms, cellular automata rules, bioinformatics, sorting networks, robotics, assembly code generation, software repair, scheduling, communication protocols, symbolic regression, reverse engineering, and empirical model discovery. This paper observes that, despite considerable variation in the techniques employed by the various researchers and research groups that produced these human-competitive results, many of the results share several common features. Many of the results were achieved by using a developmental process and by using native representations regularly used by engineers in the fields involved. The best individual in the initial generation of the run of genetic programming often contains only a small number of operative parts. Most of the results that duplicated the functionality of previously issued patents were novel solutions, not infringing solutions. In addition, the production of human-competitive results, as well as the increased intricacy of the results, are broadly correlated to increased availability of computing power tracked by Moore's law. The paper ends by predicting that the increased availability of computing power (through both parallel computing and Moore's law) should result in the production, in the future, of an increasing flow of human-competitive results, as well as more intricate and impressive results. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.",Automated design; Developmental genetic programming; Genetic programming; Human-competitive results; Moore's law; Parallel computing; Patented inventions,Analog circuits; Bioinformatics; Cellular automata; Communication; Game theory; Image communication systems; Image recognition; Lens antennas; Network protocols; Networks (circuits); Optical communication; Parallel architectures; Parallel flow; Patents and inventions; Pattern recognition systems; Quantum computers; Reengineering; Reverse engineering; Automated design; Developmental genetic programming; Moore's Law; Parallel Computing; Patented invention; Genetic programming,

When combined with quantum machine learning (QML) models, the resulting CQML model is a generalized unified recursive kernel ridge regression that exploits correlations implicitly encoded in training data composed of multiple levels in multiple dimensions. Here, we have investigated up to three dimensions: chemical space, basis set, and electron correlation treatment. Numerical results have been obtained for atomization energies of a set of ∼7000 organic molecules with up to 7 atoms (not counting hydrogens) containing CHONFClS, as well as for ∼6000 constitutional isomers of C                             7                             H                             10                             O                             2                             . CQML learning curves for atomization energies suggest a dramatic reduction in necessary training samples calculated with the most accurate and costly method. In order to generate millisecond estimates of CCSD(T)/cc-pvdz atomization energies with prediction errors reaching chemical accuracy (∼1 kcal/mol), the CQML model requires only ∼100 training instances at CCSD(T)/cc-pvdz level, rather than thousands within conventional QML, while more training molecules are required at lower levels. Our results suggest a possibly favorable trade-off between various hierarchical approximations whose computational cost scales differently with electron number.                          © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,,

However, due to various user's habits, the discharging profiles of the lithium-ion battery are totally different in practice, thereby limiting applications of many feature-based methods in real operations. Compared with the discharging process, the charging process is usually executed in a more peaceable and predictable manner. Therefore, two time-related aging features are extracted from the constant current-constant voltage charging process in this work. By introducing the quantum computing theory into the classical intelligent learning model, an improved Gaussian process regression framework, as well as its application to describe relations between extracted features and the battery SOH, is proposed and illustrated in detail.

A reliable prediction of toxic effects of chemicals in living systems is highly desirable in domains such as cosmetics, drug design, food safety, and manufacturing chemical compounds. Toxicity prediction topic requires several new approaches for knowledge discovery from data to paradigm composite associations between the modules of the chemical compound; such techniques need more computational cost as the number of chemical compounds increases. State-of-the-art prediction methods such as neural network and multi-layer regression that requires either tuning parameters or complex transformations of predictor or outcome variables are not achieving high accuracy results. This paper proposes a Quantum Inspired Genetic Programming “QIGP” model to improve the prediction accuracy. Genetic Programming is utilized to give a linear equation for calculating toxicity degree more accurately. Quantum computing is employed to improve the selection of the best-of-run individuals and handles parsimony pressure to reduce the complexity of the solutions. The results of the internal validation analysis indicated that the QIGP model has the better goodness of fit statistics and significantly outperforms the Neural Network model. © 2017 International Journal of Artificial Intelegence Research.

Machine learning models are effective means to reveal interaction mechanisms. Here we studied the ability of a quantum machine learning approach to classify and rank binding affinities. Using simplified data sets of a small number of DNA sequences derived from actual binding affinity experiments, we trained a commercially available quantum annealer to classify and rank transcription factor binding. The results were compared to state-of-the-art classical approaches for the same simplified data sets, including simulated annealing, simulated quantum annealing, multiple linear regression, LASSO, and extreme gradient boosting. Despite technological limitations, we find a slight advantage in classification performance and nearly equal ranking performance using the quantum annealer for these fairly small training data sets.

To solve the abovementioned characteristics of a MEL time series, the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVR) hybridizing with meta-heuristic algorithms is applied to simulate the nonlinear system of a MEL time series. As it is known that the fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) has several embedded drawbacks that lead to problems, this paper applies a quantum computing mechanism (QCM) to empower each fruit fly to possess quantum behavior during the searching processes, i.e., a QFOA algorithm. Eventually, the cat chaotic mapping function is introduced into the QFOA algorithm, namely CQFOA, to implement the chaotic global perturbation strategy to help fruit flies to escape from the local optima while the population's diversity is poor. Finally, a new MEL forecasting method, namely the LS-SVR-CQFOA model, is established by hybridizing the LS-SVR model with CQFOA. The experimental results illustrate that, in three datasets, the proposed LS-SVR-CQFOA model is superior to other alternative models, including BPNN (back-propagation neural networks), LS-SVR-CQPSO (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm), LS-SVR-CQTS (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum tabu search algorithm), LS-SVR-CQGA (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum genetic algorithm), LS-SVR-CQBA (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum bat algorithm), LS-SVR-FOA, and LS-SVR-QFOA models, in terms of forecasting accuracy indexes.

Hence, to continue exploring possible improvements of the original BA and to receive more appropriate parameters of an SVR model, this paper applies quantum computing mechanism to empower each bat to possess quantum behavior, then, employs the chaotic mapping function to execute the global chaotic disturbance process, to enlarge bat's search space and to make the bat jump out from the local optima when population is over accumulation.

Several linear and nonlinear regression models like Langmuir, Freundlich, D-R, Tempkin isotherm models are in vogue for determining the adsorbing capacity of standard adsorbents used for this purpose. In this article, we propose a novel quantum inspired backpropagation multilayer perceptron (QBMLP) based on quantum gates (single qubit rotation gates and two qubit controlled-not gates) for the prediction of this adsorption behavior exhibited by calcareous soil oftentimes used in adsorbing miscible iron from aqueous solutions. The backpropagation learning formulae for the proposed QBMLP architecture has also been generalized for multiple number of layers in both field homogeneous and field heterogeneous configurations characterized by three standard activations, viz., sigmoid, tanh and tan 1.5h functions. Applications of the efficiency of the proposed QBMLP over the regression models are demonstrated with regards to the prediction behavior of the adsorption of iron by calcareous soil from an aqueous solution with effect to various characteristic adsorbent parameters. The adsorption process is considered to be a physical one since the activation energy (EA) of ferrous ion adsorption is 9.469 kJ mol-1 due to Arrhenius. Moreover, the thermodynamic parameters of Gibb's free energy (G0), enthalpy (H0) and entropy (S0) values indicate it be spontaneous. Results indicate that QBMLP predicts the adsorption behavior of calcareous soil to a very closer extent thereby obviating the need for further regression/experimental analysis. Comparison with the performance of a similar classical multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture also reveals the prediction and time efficiency of the proposed QBMLP architecture. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
