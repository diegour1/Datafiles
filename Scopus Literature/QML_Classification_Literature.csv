Therefore, early classification of it is a crucial task. Quantum machine learning and quantum neural network models can play an effective role in multiclass classification problems. Compared to standard deep and machine learning classifiers, the quantum variational classifier may lead to less memory usage, accuracy, and portability for respiratory disease detection. This article proposes a hybrid respiratory lung disease detection framework based on classical CNN and Quantum classifiers. It combines a classical deep feature extraction model with quantum classifiers. A new custom convolutional neural network (CCNN) deep learning model is proposed to perform feature extraction, and the Multi-Multi-Single (MMS) & Multi-Single-Multi-Single (MSMS) are proposed as quantum machine learning algorithms. These two quantum classifiers are built via a quantum variational circuit with encoding, entanglement, and measurement properties. The tests were carried out on the COVID-19 Radiography Dataset (CRD), which contains 15,153 chest X-ray images of COVID-19, Viral, and Normal. The experimental results revealed that the proposed model had the highest training and testing accuracy of 98.9% and 98.1%, on the CRD dataset, with a computation cost of 0.07 and 0.08 respectively. This hybrid model performs better than the other standard deep learning models. Additionally, we validated our MMS and MSMS quantum classifiers by deploying them on the IBM Q-QASM real-time quantum computer. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Convolutional neural network; Feature extraction; Quantum classifier; Quantum machine learning; Qubits,Biological organs; Chemical detection; Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Statistical tests; Convolutional neural network; Disease detection; Features extraction; Human respiratory system; Hybrid framework; Learning models; Machine-learning; Quantum classifier; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; accuracy; Article; artificial neural network; classifier; comparative study; conceptual framework; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; cost; covid 19 radiography dataset; deep learning; encoding; entanglement; experimental model; feature extraction; hybrid framework; lung disease; machine learning; measurement; memory; multi multi single algorithm; multi single multi single algorithm; multiclass classification; nonhuman; physical parameters; quantum classifier; quantum mechanics; quantum variational circuit; radiological parameters; residual neural network; thorax radiography; training; Feature extraction,Article

These algorithms supply powerful instruments with significant engineering, industry, and science applications. The Quantum-inspired metaheuristic algorithms were developed by integrating Quantum Computing (QC) concepts into metaheuristic algorithms. The QC-inspired metaheuristic algorithms solve combinational and numerical optimization problems to achieve higher-performing results than conventional metaheuristic algorithms. The QC is used more than any other strategy for accelerating convergence, enhancing exploration, and exploitation, significantly influencing metaheuristic algorithms’ performance. The QC is a new field of research that includes elements from mathematics, physics, and computing. QC has attracted increasing attention among scientists, technologists, and industrialists. During the current decade, it has provided a research platform for the scientific, technical, and industrial areas. In QC, metaheuristic algorithms can be improved by the parallel processing feature. This feature helps to find the best solutions for optimization problems. The Quantum-inspired metaheuristic algorithms have been used in the optimization fields. In this paper, a review of different usages of QC in metaheuristics has been presented. This review also shows a classification of the Quantum-inspired metaheuristic algorithms in optimization problems and discusses their applications in science and engineering.

Quantum simulations, simulation of chemical reactions, solution of optimization problems and quantum neural networks (QNNs) are some examples. However, problems such as noise, limited number of qubits and circuit depth, and gradient vanishing must be resolved before we can use them to their full potential. In the field of quantum machine learning, several models have been proposed. In general, in order to train these different models, we use the gradient of a cost function with respect to the model parameters. In order to obtain this gradient, we must compute the derivative of this function with respect to the model parameters. One of the most used methods in the literature to perform this task is the parameter-shift rule method. This method consists of evaluating the cost function twice for each parameter of the QNN. A problem with this method is that the number of evaluations grows linearly with the number of parameters. In this work, we study an alternative method, called evolution strategies (ES), which are a family of black box optimization algorithms which iteratively update the parameters using a search gradient. An advantage of the ES method is that in using it, one can control the number of times the cost function will be evaluated. We apply the ES method to the binary classification task, showing that this method is a viable alternative for training QNNs. However, we observe that its performance will be strongly dependent on the hyperparameters used. Furthermore, we also observe that this method, alike the parameter shift rule method, suffers from the problem of gradient vanishing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Binary classification; Evolution strategies; Hybrid quantum-classical neural networks; Quantum neural networks,Function evaluation; Iterative methods; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Quantum chemistry; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Binary classification; Classical neural networks; Cost-function; Evolution strategies; Hybrid quantum-classical neural network; Modeling parameters; Parameter shifts; Quanta computers; Quantum neural networks; Quantum-classical; Cost functions,Article

The mean skin surface temperature was measured in neck, forearm, abdomen and calf region for normal, overweight and obese children. Two modified pre-trained CNN (MobileNet-V2 and VGG-16) and Customized Net are studied for multi-class categorization of normal, overweight and obese thermograms. In addition, VQC was simulated and compared with the performance of deep learning techniques. Among the regional temperature studied, abdominal region exhibited high temperature difference of 3.72 °C (10.96%) and 5.56 °C (16.84%) between normal vs overweight and normal vs obese, respectively. The proposed Customized Net model achieved the best overall accuracy of 91.6% and 89.3% for abdomen region and neck region, respectively. Similarly, VQC has illustrated best classification accuracy in neck (84.4%) and abdomen (82.2%) regions.

However, the strongest adversaries in quantum information science are unwanted environmental effects such as decoherence and dissipation. Here, we address how to control and harness these unwanted effects that arise from the coupling of a system with its environment, to provide stationary entangled states for quantum machine learning (QML). To do so, we design a dissipative quantum channel, i.e., a two-qubit system interacting with a squeezed vacuum field reservoir, and study the output state of the channel by solving the corresponding master equation, especially, in the small squeezing regime. We show that the time-dependent output state of the channel is the so-called two-qubit X-states that generalize many families of entangled two-qubit states. Also, by considering a general Bell diagonal state as the initial state of the system, we reveal that this dissipative channel generates two well-known classes of entangled mixed state and Werner-like states in the steady-state regime. Moreover, this channel provides an efficient way to determine whether a given initial state results in a stationary entangled state or not. Finally, we examine the potential application of the designed two-qubit channel for QML. In this line, we propose a general theoretical scheme for quantum neural networks (QNNs) implemented with the variational quantum circuits, which encode data in continuous variables (CVs) of the two-qubit states. The linear (also referred to as affine) and nonlinear (activation function) transformations are enacted in the QNN using the stationary states of the two-qubit channel and measurement process, respectively. Finally, we proceed to test our proposed model by solving some supervised binary classification tasks. Integrating the non-unitary transformation and parallel-processed neural computing on such a two-qubit channel establishes the requirements for a meaningful QNN. Such a CV-QNN model with sufficient layers may execute any algorithm implementable on a universal CV quantum computer. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Dissipative two-qubit channel; Quantum machine learning; Squeezed reservoir; Stationary entangled states,Communication channels (information theory); Linear transformations; Neural network models; Quantum channel; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Qubits; Dissipative two-qubit channel; Entangled state; Machine-learning; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum neural networks; Qubit channels; Squeezed reservoirs; Stationary entangled state; Two-qubit; Machine learning,Article

While decoherence of qubits is expected to decrease the performance of QML models, it is unclear to what extent the diminished performance can be compensated for by adding ancillas to the models and accordingly increasing the virtual bond dimension of the models. We investigate here the competition between decoherence and adding ancillas on the classification performance of two models, with an analysis of the decoherence effect from the perspective of regression. We present numerical evidence that the fully decohered unitary tree tensor network (TTN) with two ancillas performs at least as well as the non-decohered unitary TTN, suggesting that it is beneficial to add at least two ancillas to the unitary TTN regardless of the amount of decoherence may be consequently introduced. © 2023, The Author(s).",Decoherence; Quantum machine learning; Tensor networks,Machine learning; Quantum theory; Qubits; Classification performance; Decoherence; Decoherence effects; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Performance; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Tensor network; Virtual bonds; Tensors,Article

Harnessing the peculiarities of quantum computation for machine learning tasks offers promising advantages. Quantum-inspired machine learning has revealed how relevant benefits for machine learning problems can be obtained using the quantum information theory even without employing quantum computers. In the recent past, experiments have demonstrated how to design an algorithm for binary classification inspired by the method of quantum state discrimination, which exhibits high performance with respect to several standard classifiers. However, a generalization of this quantum-inspired binary classifier to a multi-class scenario remains nontrivial. Typically, a simple solution in machine learning decomposes multi-class classification into a combinatorial number of binary classifications, with a concomitant increase in computational resources. In this study, we introduce a quantum-inspired classifier that avoids this problem. Inspired by quantum state discrimination, our classifier performs multi-class classification directly without using binary classifiers. We first compared the performance of the quantum-inspired multi-class classifier with eleven standard classifiers. The comparison revealed an excellent performance of the quantum-inspired classifier. Comparing these results with those obtained using the decomposition in binary classifiers shows that our method improves the accuracy and reduces the time complexity. Therefore, the quantum-inspired machine learning algorithm proposed in this work is an effective and efficient framework for multi-class classification. Finally, although these advantages can be attained without employing any quantum component in the hardware, we discuss how it is possible to implement the model in quantum hardware. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Multi-class classification; Quantum information; Quantum-inspired machine learning,Classification (of information); Classifiers; Computer hardware; Information theory; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Binary classification; Binary classifiers; Learning tasks; Machine-learning; Multi-class classification; Performance; Quantum Information; Quantum machines; Quantum state discrimination; Quantum-inspired machine learning; Machine learning,Article

However, due to limited qubits or hardware noise, conducting large-scale experiments often requires significant resources. Moreover, the output of the model is susceptible to corruption by quantum hardware noise. To address this issue, we propose the use of ensemble techniques, which involve constructing a single machine learning model based on multiple instances of quantum neural networks. In particular, we implement bagging and AdaBoost techniques, with different data loading configurations, and evaluate their performance on both synthetic and real-world classification and regression tasks. To assess the potential performance improvement under different environments, we conducted experiments on both simulated, noiseless software and IBM superconducting-based QPUs, suggesting these techniques can mitigate the quantum hardware noise. Additionally, we quantify the amount of resources saved using these ensemble techniques. Our findings indicate that these methods enable the construction of large, powerful models even on relatively small quantum devices. © 2023, The Author(s).",Bagging; Boosting; Ensemble technique; Quantum machine learning; Quantum neural network,Machine learning; Qubits; Bagging; Boosting; Current generation; Ensemble techniques; Machine-learning; Performance; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum neural networks; Resource savings; Adaptive boosting,Article

SurfNetv2 is an established high-speed classical convolution neural network (CNN) model for image recognition, and QSurfNet further inherits the legacy by introducing quantum CNN (QCNN) layers, reducing the number of convolution blocks in the model architecture and the image size required for recognition. The QSurfNet architecture consists of a QCNN module, a feature extraction module, and a surface defect recognition module. The algorithm works on end-to-end supervised quantum machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify the surface defect categories of the surface defect image datasets. For this research, we used the 8 × 8-pixel and 12 × 12-pixel resolution RGB image information from the public Northeastern University dataset, and an industry-sourced calcium silicate board private dataset. We used principal component analysis for image dimensionality reduction across the R, G, and B channels, individually. We compare the performance of QSurfNet with six state-of-the-art methods on these datasets upon recognition results on test accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Measure performance metrics. QSurfNet is novel in terms of the algorithm design methodology that can turn any classical CNN algorithm into state-of-the-art QCNN. Hence, the proposed methodology contributes to the practical feasibility of developing novel convolutional architecture designs of hybrid quantum–classical algorithms. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Industry 4.0; Parameterized quantum circuit; Quantum convolutional neural network; Quantum machine learning; Surface defect recognition,Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Image recognition; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Network architecture; Silicates; Surface defects; Timing circuits; Convolutional neural network; Defect recognition; Machine-learning; Parameterized; Parameterized quantum circuit; Quantum circuit; Quantum convolutional neural network; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Surface defect recognition; Convolution,Article

IDSs are protective systems that detect outsider infiltrations, unauthorised accesses and malfunctions occurring in computer networks. Intrusions can be detected and reported to the network administrator by IDSs using various pieces of information such as port scanning and irregular traffic detection. Intrusion detection is a classification problem, and identifying effective features is an essential aspect of classification methods. Standard methods used for classification are neural networks, fuzzy logic, data mining techniques and metaheuristics. One of the novel metaheuristic algorithms introduced to address optimisation problems is the Horse herd Optimisation Algorithm (HOA). This paper introduces a new approach on the basis of HOA for network intrusion detection. The new method uses horse behaviours in the herd to select effective features to detect intrusions and interactions between features. For the purpose of the new approach, HOA is first updated into a discrete algorithm using the floor function. The binarised algorithm is then converted into a quantum-inspired optimiser by integrating the concepts of quantum computing with HOA to improve the social behaviours of the horses in the herd. In quantum computing, Q-bit and Q-gate aid in striking a greater balance between the exploration and exploitation processes. The resulting algorithm is then converted into a multi-objective algorithm, where the objectives can be chosen from a set of optimal solutions. The new algorithm, MQBHOA, is then used for intrusion detection in computer networks, which is a multi-objective optimisation problem. For the classification, the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifier is applied. To evaluate the new algorithm’s performance, two data sets, NSL-KDD (Network Security Laboratory—Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining) and CSE-CIC-IDS2018, are employed in which the network packets are classified into five categories: normal packets plus four intrusions packet types of Denial of Service (DoS), User to Root (U2R), Remote to Local (R2L) and Probing (Prob). The new algorithm’s performance was evaluated and compared with other well-known metaheuristic algorithms, and the influence of the parameters of the algorithm on the degree of intrusion was investigated. The results show a 6% more success rate in the average size of feature selection and the accuracy of classification in comparison with other evaluated algorithms. It also demonstrates an accuracy of 99.8% in detecting network intrusions compared to other methods. © 2023, The Author(s).",Classification; Feature selection; Horse herd optimisation algorithm; Metaheuristic; Network intrusion detection,Classification (of information); Data mining; Denial-of-service attack; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Genetic algorithms; Intrusion detection; Multiobjective optimization; Nearest neighbor search; Network security; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Quantum computers; Features selection; Horse herd optimization algorithm; Intrusion-Detection; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Metaheuristic; Network intrusion detection; New approaches; Optimization algorithms; Performance; Quantum Computing; Feature Selection,Article

Due to the exponential growth of data, how constructing reasonable and efficient dimensionality reduction algorithms has been an open challenge recently. In this paper, we propose a quantum linear discriminant analysis algorithm for dimensionality reduction. In the proposed algorithm, the idea of quantum solving linear equations is utilized to obtain the shadow principal components and an intermediate state. After that, the special unitary operations are designed to assist in completing the dimensionality reduction. The theoretical analysis shows the proposed algorithm has exponential acceleration on the number of vectors and a quadratic speedup on the dimensionality of the original data space. Since this algorithm solves the restriction that the between-class scatter matrix must be reversible, it makes the algorithm more applicable. Moreover, instead of getting the quantum state in the projection direction, the algorithm obtains the corresponding quantum state of dimensionality reduction data so that the outputs can be directly applied to other quantum machine learning algorithms. To illustrate it, a simple example, quantum K-nearest Neighbor classification, is provided. © 2023",Linear discriminant analysis; Quantum computing; Quantum dimensionality reduction algorithm; Quantum machine learning,Acceleration; Data reduction; Discriminant analysis; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Quantum computers; Vector spaces; Data preprocessing; Dimensionality reduction; Dimensionality reduction algorithms; Linear discriminant analyze; Machine-learning; Quantum Computing; Quantum dimensionality reduction algorithm; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum state; Machine learning,Article

Here we focus on quantum kernels empirically designed for image classification and demonstrate a field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) implementation. We show that the quantum kernel estimation by our heterogeneous CPU–FPGA computing is 470 times faster than that by a conventional CPU implementation.

Firstly, we build a programmable free-space photonic quantum processor, which enables the programmed implementation of various hybrid quantum-classical computing algorithms. Then, we code the designed variational quantum classifier with AL into the quantum processor, and execute comparative tests for the classifiers with and without the AL strategy.

In quantum-computing theory, the vectors corresponding to quantum states are all complex values, so there is a gap between these two areas. Presently, complex-valued neural networks have been studied, but their practical applications are few, let alone in the downstream tasks of natural language processing such as sentiment analysis and language modeling. In fact, the complex-valued neural network can use the imaginary part information to embed hidden information and can express more complex information, which is suitable for modeling complex natural language.

The destructive use of quantum steganography methods to establish illegal covert communications is rising, so it is essential to introduce ways to detect hidden data in a quantum medium. Accordingly, this paper presents a frequency-based universal audio steganalysis approach to detecting quantum steganography. First, based on the quantum Fourier transform, the characteristic of the quantum spectrum centroid (QSC) was computed, and its circuit network was implemented to extract feature vectors. The proposed method classifies quantum audio signals using a quantum machine learning approach called a quantum ensemble of quantum classifiers. This approach was implemented within the framework of the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm, which uses the superposition property to create an ensemble of classifiers evaluated in parallel, significantly increasing the computational speed. The accuracy weight of the classifiers is adjusted based on the classifiers' performance in training data classification; finally, the measurement of the first n qubits of the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm predicts whether the quantum audio signals belong to the stego or clean class. The idea stems from the classic ensemble methods that try to build more robust models by combining different classifiers.

The ResMPS can be treated as a network where its layers map the “hidden” features to the outputs (e.g., classifications), and the variational parameters of the layers are the functions of the features of the samples (e.g., pixels of images). This is different from neural network, where the layers map feed-forwardly the features to the output. The ResMPS can equip with the non-linear activations and dropout layers, and outperforms the state-of-the-art tensor network models in terms of efficiency, stability, and expression power. Besides, ResMPS is interpretable from the perspective of polynomial expansion, where the factorization and exponential machines naturally emerge. Our work contributes to connecting and hybridizing neural and tensor networks, which is crucial to further enhance our understanding of the working mechanisms and improve the performance of both models. © 2023 The Author(s).

Recent quantum algorithms provide a new perspective for solving CO problems and have the potential to demonstrate quantum advantage. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a well-known quantum heuristic for CO constructed by a parametric quantum circuit. However, QAOA is originally designed for unconstrained problems and the circuit parameters and solutions are jointly solved with time-consuming iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel quantum neural network (QNN) for learning CO problems in a supervised manner to achieve better and faster results. We focus on the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) with matching constraints and the node permutation invariance property. To this end, a quantum neural network called QAP-QNN is devised to translate the QAP into a constrained vertex classification task.

To address this difficulty, a multimodal quantum-inspired salp swarm algorithm, integrating kmeans clustering technique, is proposed to substitute the 2D peak searching to obtain multiple maxima of the MUSIC algorithm.

In particular, there is an emerging body of work which suggests that generic, data agnostic quantum machine learning (QML) architectures may suffer from severe trainability issues, with the gradient of typical variational parameters vanishing exponentially in the number of qubits. Additionally, the high expressibility of QML models can lead to overfitting on training data and poor generalisation performance. A promising strategy to combat both of these difficulties is to construct models which explicitly respect the symmetries inherent in their data, so-called geometric quantum machine learning (GQML). In this work, we utilise the techniques of GQML for the task of image classification, building new QML models which are equivariant with respect to reflections of the images. We find that these networks are capable of consistently and significantly outperforming generic ansatze on complicated real-world image datasets, bringing high-resolution image classification via quantum computers closer to reality.

We assume that Alice delegates QST task of a distant source for which she has no access to a third-party player Bob accessing to the source while preserving the source privacy against the operations realized by Bob. Encrypted QST algorithm is proposed which encodes or maps source computational basis states by exploiting phase estimation and feature mapping concept of quantum machine learning (QML). Bob maps basis states to eigenvalues of a specially designed unitary operator in an entangled manner with his ancillary qubits while teleporting the source qubits back to Alice before applying conventional QST.

In machine learning, complex multiple multilinear correlations may also exist within input features. In this article, we present a quantum-inspired multilinear model, named residual tensor train (ResTT), to capture the multiple multilinear correlations of features, from low to high orders, within a single model. ResTT is able to build a robust decision boundary in a high-dimensional space for solving fitting and classification tasks. In particular, we prove that the fully connected layer and the Volterra series can be taken as special cases of ResTT. Furthermore, we derive the rule for weight initialization that stabilizes the training of ResTT based on a mean-field analysis. We prove that such a rule is much more relaxed than that of tensor train (TT), which means that ResTT can easily address the vanishing and exploding gradient problem that exists in the existing TT models. Numerical experiments demonstrate that ResTT outperforms the state-of-the-art tensor network and benchmark deep learning models on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets.

However, higher dimensional quantum systems constitute a promising alternative and are increasingly explored in theory and practice. Here, we explore the capabilities of multi-level quantum systems, so-called qudits, for their use in a quantum machine learning context. We formulate classification and regression problems with the data re-uploading approach and demonstrate that a quantum circuit operating on a single qudit is able to successfully learn highly non-linear decision boundaries of classification problems such as the MNIST digit recognition problem. We demonstrate that the performance strongly depends on the relation between the qudit states representing the labels and the structure of labels in the training data set. Such a bias can lead to substantial performance improvement over qubit-based circuits in cases where the labels, the qudit states, and the operators employed to encode the data are well-aligned. Furthermore, we elucidate the influence of the choice of the elementary operators and show that a squeezing operator is necessary to achieve good performances. We also show that there exists a trade-off for qudit systems between the number of circuit-generating operators in each processing layer and the total number of layers needed to achieve a given accuracy. Finally, we compare classification results from numerically exact simulations and their equivalent implementation on actual IBM quantum hardware.

Existing deep learning models for HSIs are usually performed in a traditional learning paradigm. Being emerging machines, quantum computers are limited in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. The quantum theory offers a new paradigm for designing deep learning models. Motivated by the quantum circuit (QC) model, we propose a quantum-inspired spectral-spatial network (QSSN) for HSI feature extraction. The proposed QSSN consists of a phase-prediction module (PPM) and a measurement-like fusion module (MFM) inspired from quantum theory to dynamically fuse spectral and spatial information. Specifically, QSSN uses a quantum representation to represent an HSI cuboid and extracts joint spectral-spatial features using MFM. An HSI cuboid and its phases predicted by PPM are used in the quantum representation. Using QSSN as the building block, we further propose an end-to-end quantum-inspired spectral-spatial pyramid network (QSSPN) for HSI feature extraction and classification. In this pyramid framework, QSSPN progressively learns feature representations by cascading QSSN blocks and performs classification with a softmax classifier. It is the first attempt to introduce quantum theory in HSI processing model design. Substantial experiments are conducted on three HSI datasets to verify the superiority of the proposed QSSPN framework over the state-of-the-art methods. © 2023 IEEE.",Photogrammetry and remote sensing,,Conference paper

It is a key step to facilitate downstream interpretations such as differential expression, trajectory inference, etc. scRNA-seq data contains technical variations that could affect the interpretation of the cell types. Therefore, gene selection, also known as feature selection in data science, plays an important role in selecting informative genes for scRNA-seq cell type identification. Generally speaking, feature selection methods are categorized into filter-, wrapper-, and embedded-based approaches. From the existing literature, methods from filter- and embedded-based approaches are widely applied in scRNA-seq gene selection tasks. The wrapper-based method that gives promising results in other fields has yet been extensively utilized for selecting gene features from scRNA-seq data; in addition, most of the existing wrapper methods used in this field are clustering instead of classification-based. With a large number of annotated data available today, this study applied a classification-based approach as an alternative to the clustering-based wrapper method. In our work, a quantum-inspired differential evolution (QDE) wrapped with a classification method was introduced to select a subset of genes from twelve well-known scRNA-seq transcriptomic datasets to identify cell types. In particular, the QDE was combined with different machine-learning (ML) classifiers namely logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM) with linear and radial basis function kernels, as well as extreme learning machine.

The performance of the VQOCC is compared with that of the one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM), the kernel principal component analysis (PCA), and the deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) using handwritten digit and Fashion-MNIST datasets. The numerical experiment examined various structures of VQOCC by varying data encoding, the number of parameterized quantum circuit layers, and the size of the latent feature space.

Machine learning is all about discovering patterns and relationships in data. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) blends Machine Learning (ML) and Quantum Computing (QC) technologies. QML approaches may be utilized efficiently for data classification problems. Quantum Feature Maps (QFMs) are used for transferring non-linear classical data from lower input space to higher dimensional Hilbert space. Calculating the inner product between data points for classification purposes is exceedingly costly when Hilbert Space is vast. Quantum Kernel Techniques, which are immediate results of QFMs, are used to overcome this problem. In general, we cannot claim that QFMs are superior than Classical Feature Maps (CFMs); yet, there are datasets for which QFMs perform better while CFMs are less effective. It gives us the motivation behind using QFM for classification. In this paper, we proposed two new non-linear encoding functions based quantum kernels for data classification in the range [0, 2π]. The make-moons and make-circles datasets are utilized in this article to perform binary classifications using Qiskit and Sklearn.

Currently, manually classifying and counting pests is time consuming, and enumeration of population accuracy might be affected by a variety of subjective measures. Additionally, due to pests’ various scales and behaviors, the current pest localization algorithms based on CNN are unsuitable for effective pest management in agriculture. To overcome the existing challenges, in this study, a method is developed for the localization and classification of pests. For localization purposes, the YOLOv5 is trained using the optimal learning hyperparameters which more accurately localize the pest region in plant images with 0.93 F1 scores. After localization, pest images are classified into Paddy with pest/Paddy without pest using the proposed quantum machine learning model, which consists of fifteen layers with two-qubit nodes.

There exists the potential for a quantum advantage due to the intractability of quantum operations on a classical computer. Many datasets used in machine learning are crowd sourced or contain some private information, but to the best of our knowledge, no current QML models are equipped with privacy-preserving features. This raises concerns as it is paramount that models do not expose sensitive information. Thus, privacy-preserving algorithms need to be implemented with QML. One solution is to make the machine learning algorithm differentially private, meaning the effect of a single data point on the training dataset is minimized. Differentially private machine learning models have been investigated, but differential privacy has not been thoroughly studied in the context of QML. In this study, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical model that is trained to preserve privacy using differentially private optimization algorithm. This marks the first proof-of-principle demonstration of privacy-preserving QML. The experiments demonstrate that differentially private QML can protect user-sensitive information without signficiantly diminishing model accuracy. Although the quantum model is simulated and tested on a classical computer, it demonstrates potential to be efficiently implemented on near-term quantum devices [noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)]. The approach’s success is illustrated via the classification of spatially classed two-dimensional datasets and a binary MNIST classification. This implementation of privacy-preserving QML will ensure confidentiality and accurate learning on NISQ technology. © 2023, The Author(s).",,,Article

This unique feature allows exponential speed-up in solving certain problems. However, this advantage does not apply universally, and challenges arise when combining classical and quantum computing to achieve acceleration in computation speed. This paper aims to address these challenges by exploring the current state of quantum machine learning and benchmarking the performance of quantum and classical algorithms in terms of accuracy. Specifically, we conducted experiments with three datasets for binary classification, implementing Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Quantum SVM (QSVM) algorithms. Our findings suggest that the QSVM algorithm outperforms classical SVM on complex datasets, and the performance gap between quantum and classical models increases with dataset complexity, as simple models tend to overfit with complex datasets. While there is still a long way to go in terms of developing quantum hardware with sufficient resources, quantum machine learning holds great potential in areas such as unsupervised learning and generative models.

However, existing QAS algorithms require calculating the ground-truth performances of a substantial number of quantum circuits during the search process, rendering them computationally demanding and limiting their applicability to large-scale quantum circuits. Recently, a predictor-based QAS has been proposed to address this challenge by estimating circuit performance directly based on their structures using a predictor trained on a set of labeled quantum circuits. However, the predictor is trained by purely supervised learning, which suffers from poor generalization ability when labeled training circuits are scarce. It is highly time-consuming to obtain a substantial number of labeled quantum circuits because the gate parameters of quantum circuits need to be optimized until convergence to obtain their ground-truth performances. To overcome these limitations, we propose GSQAS, a graph self-supervised QAS that trains a predictor by self-supervised learning. Specifically, we first pre-train a graph encoder using a well-designed pretext task on a large number of unlabeled quantum circuits, aiming to generate meaningful representations of quantum circuits. Subsequently, the downstream predictor is trained on a small set of quantum circuits’ representations and their corresponding labels. Once the encoder is trained, it becomes applicable to various downstream tasks. To effectively encode spatial topology information and avoid huge dimensions of feature vectors for large-scale quantum circuits, we propose a graph-based encoding scheme for quantum circuits.

Recently, quantum machine learning has emerged as a potential solution for large-scale data processing by harnessing the exponentially computational power of quantum computers. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate the feasibility of using quantum deep neural networks for phytoplankton classification. Hybrid quantum-classical convolutional and residual neural networks are developed based on the classical architectures. These models strike a balance between the limited function of current quantum devices and the large size of phytoplankton images, making it possible to perform phytoplankton classification on near-term quantum computers. Our quantum models demonstrate superior performance compared to their classical counterparts, exhibiting faster convergence, higher classification accuracy and lower accuracy fluctuation.

To overcome this problem, we have proposed a two-step technique. In the first step, to reduce the vast number of genes or features, an ensemble of popular rank-based feature selection algorithms with filter evaluation metrics are used to select a group of top-ranking genes. In the next step, the quantum-inspired owl search algorithm (QIOSAf), a new filter fitness function-based metaheuristic search technique incorporating concepts from quantum computing, is developed to identify the best subset of genes from the predetermined list. The experimental findings reveal that the ensemble approach in the first step can select more dominant groups of genes than each of the individual filters. Furthermore, it has been found that QIOSAf can reduce the cardinality of the selected optimum gene subset with comparable classification accuracy and requires lesser computational time than our earlier proposed QIOSA-based wrapper approach (i.e. QIOSAw). Besides, compared with three popular evolutionary feature subset selection algorithms, QIOSAf efficiently reduces the optimum cardinality of the gene subset while maintaining acceptable classification accuracy. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",ensemble approach; metaheuristics search; Microarray datasets; optimum gene subset; owl search algorithm; quantum-inspired computing,Birds; Classification (of information); Evolutionary algorithms; Feature Selection; Learning algorithms; Optimization; Set theory; Cardinalities; Classification accuracy; Ensemble approaches; Meta-heuristic search; Microarray dataset; Microarrays data; Optimum gene subset; Owl search algorithm; Quantum-inspired computing; Search Algorithms; Genes,Article

We aimed to develop an efficient handcrafted model that could accurately discriminate “bad counters” vs. “good counters” in mental arithmetic. Materials and method: We studied a public mental arithmetic task performance EEG dataset comprising 20-channel EEG signal segments recorded from 36 healthy right-handed subjects divided into two classes 10 “bad counters” and 26 “good counters”. The original 60-second EEG samples are divided into 424 15-second segments (119 and 305 belonging to the “bad counters” and “good counters”, respectively) to input into our model.

On the contrary, classical Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is known for handling noisy data due to the stochastic and temporal behaviour of the spiking neuron signals. However, it is not always feasible to train the weights of the classical SNN due to stochastic and non-differentiable spiking signals. Recent applications of quantum machine learning to stochastic modelling have predicted that quantum computing would prove to be a significant advantage, hence catapulting the study of quantum and neuromorphic computing to a new level of development. Motivated by these observations, this paper introduces a shallow hybrid classical–quantum spiking feedforward neural network referred to as Spiking Quantum Neural Network (SQNN) for dealing with a robust image classification task in the presence of noise and adversarial attacks. The proposed SQNN offers the inherent capabilities of processing unforeseen noisy test images due to its spatial and temporal information. An efficient variational quantum circuit training with the help of a standard back-propagation algorithm obviates the classical Spiking Time-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and Spike-Prop algorithms, which are often found inefficient in training the feedforward SNN. The proposed SQNN is extensively tested and benchmarked on the PennyLane Quantum Simulator. Experimental results show that the proposed SQNN model supersedes the feedforward SNN (SFNN), Random Quantum Neural Networks (RQNN), AlexNet and ResNet-18 on unseen test images with added noise from the FashionMNIST, MNIST, KMNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Hybrid classical–quantum neural networks; Quantum machine learning; Spiking neural networks; Variational quantum circuit,Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Deep neural networks; Image classification; Learning systems; Neurons; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Stochastic systems; Timing circuits; Classical-quantum; Hybrid classical–quantum neural network; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Quantum circuit; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum neural networks; Spiking neural network; Variational quantum circuit; Feedforward neural networks,Article

These systems leverage the parallel processing power of quantum computers to perform complex computations while utilizing classical algorithms to handle the vast amounts of data involved in imaging. The hybrid approach is intended to improve accuracy and speed compared to traditional classical methods. Further research and development in this area can revolutionize the way medical images are classified and help improve patient diagnosis and treatment. The use of Conventional Neural Networks (CNN) for the classification and diagnosis of medical images using big datasets requires, in most cases, the use of special high-performance computing machines, which are very expensive and hard to access by most researchers. A new form of Machine Learning (ML), Quantum machine learning (QML), is being introduced as an emerging strategy to overcome this problem. A hybrid quantum–classical CNN uses both quantum and classical convolution layers designed to use a parameterized quantum circuit. This means that the computing model utilizes a quantum circuits approach to construct QML algorithms, which are then used to transform the quantum state to extract image hidden features. This computational acceleration is expected to achieve better algorithm performance than classical CNNs. This study intends to evaluate the performance of a Hybrid Quantum CNN (HQCNN) against a conventional CNN. This is followed by some optimizer modifications for both proposed and classical CNN methods to investigate the possible further improvement of their performance. The optimizer modification is based on forcing the optimizer to be directly adaptive to model accuracy. The optimizer adaptiveness is based on the development of an optimizer with a loss base adaptive momentum. Several algorithms are developed to achieve the above-mentioned goals, including CNN, QCNN, CNN with the adaptive optimizer, and QCNN with the Adaptive optimizer.

Despite their accuracy and sophistication, neural networks can be easily fooled by carefully designed malicious inputs known as adversarial attacks. While such vulnerabilities remain a serious challenge for classical neural networks, the extent of their existence is not fully understood in the quantum ML setting. In this paper, we benchmark the robustness of quantum ML networks, such as quantum variational classifiers (QVC), at scale by performing rigorous training for both simple and complex image datasets and through a variety of high-end adversarial attacks. Our results show that QVCs offer a notably enhanced robustness against classical adversarial attacks by learning features, which are not detected by the classical neural networks, indicating a possible quantum advantage for ML tasks. Contrarily, and remarkably, the converse is not true, with attacks on quantum networks also capable of deceiving classical neural networks. By combining quantum and classical network outcomes, we propose an adversarial attack detection technology. Traditionally quantum advantage in ML systems has been sought through increased accuracy or algorithmic speed-up, but our study has revealed the potential for a kind of quantum advantage through superior robustness of ML models, whose practical realization will address serious security concerns and reliability issues of ML algorithms employed in a myriad of applications including autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, and surveillance robotic systems. © 2023 authors.

In this paper, we propose a quantum adversarial metric learning (QAML) model based on the triplet loss function, where samples are embedded into the high-dimensional Hilbert space and the optimal metric is obtained by minimizing the triplet loss function. The QAML model employs entanglement and interference to build superposition states for triplet samples so that only one parameterized quantum circuit is needed to calculate sample distances, which reduces the demand for quantum resources. Considering the QAML model is fragile to adversarial attacks, an adversarial sample generation strategy is designed based on the quantum gradient ascent method, effectively improving the robustness against the functional adversarial attack. Simulation results show that the QAML model can effectively distinguish samples of MNIST and Iris datasets and has higher ϵ-robustness accuracy over the general quantum metric learning. The QAML model is a fundamental research problem of machine learning. As a subroutine of classification and clustering tasks, the QAML model opens an avenue for exploring quantum advantages in machine learning. © 2023, The Author(s).",Hybrid quantum-classical algorithm; Metric learning; Quantum machine learning,Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Quantum entanglement; Hybrid quantum-classical algorithm; Images classification; Learning models; Loss functions; Machine-learning; Metric learning; Model-based OPC; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum-classical; Machine learning,Article

Abnormal proliferation of leukocytes in the bone marrow leads to leukemia, a fatal blood cancer. Classification of various subtypes of WBCs is an important step in the diagnosis of leukemia. The method of automated classification of WBCs using deep convolutional neural networks is promising to achieve a significant level of accuracy, but suffers from high computational costs due to very large feature sets. Dimensionality reduction through intelligent feature selection is essential to improve the model performance with reduced computational complexity. This work proposed an improved pipeline for subtype classification of WBCs that relies on transfer learning for feature extraction using deep neural networks, followed by a wrapper feature selection approach based on a customized quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (QIEA). This algorithm, inspired by the principles of quantum physics, outperforms classical evolutionary algorithms in the exploration of search space. The reduced feature vector obtained from QIEA was then classified with multiple baseline classifiers. In order to validate the proposed methodology, a public dataset of 5000 images of five subtypes of WBCs was used. The proposed system achieves a classification accuracy of about 99% with a reduction of 90% in the size of the feature vector.

This paper presents new research that proposes a model for finding malicious domains by passively analyzing DNS data. The proposed model builds a real-time, accurate, middleweight, and fast classifier by combining a genetic algorithm for selecting DNS data features with a two-step quantum ant colony optimization (QABC) algorithm for classification. The modified two-step QABC classifier uses K-means instead of random initialization to place food sources. In order to overcome ABCs poor exploitation abilities and its convergence speed, this paper utilizes the metaheuristic QABC algorithm for global optimization problems inspired by quantum physics concepts. The use of the Hadoop framework and a hybrid machine learning approach (K-mean and QABC) to deal with the large size of uniform resource locator (URL) data is one of the main contributions of this paper.

In machine learning, a difficult problem is how to learn a model with high robustness and strong generalization ability from a limited feature space. Combining multiple models as base learners, ensemble learning (EL) can effectively improve the accuracy, generalization ability and robustness of the final model. The key to EL lies in two aspects, the performance of base learners and the choice of the combination strategy. Recently, quantum EL (QEL) has been studied. However, existing combination strategies in QEL are inadequate in considering the accuracy and variance among base learners. This paper presents a hybrid EL framework that combines quantum and classical advantages. More importantly, we propose an efficient combination strategy for improving the accuracy of classification in the framework. We verify the feasibility and efficiency of our framework and strategy by using the MNIST dataset. Simulation results show that the hybrid EL framework with our combination strategy not only has a higher accuracy and lower variance than the single model without the ensemble, but also has a better accuracy than the majority voting and the weighted voting strategies in most cases.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Ensemble learning; Quantum computing; Quantum machine learning,Learning systems; Quantum computers; Quantum efficiency; Base learners; Combination strategies; Ensemble learning; Ensemble-classifier; Generalization ability; Learning frameworks; Machine-learning; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Machine learning,Article

The high dimensionality and rich spatial/spectral information present in the hyperspectral images often increase the feature selection and classification complexity. To overcome this issue, a Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network Ensemble Random forest and Gated Recurrent Unit (Light CERG Network) is proposed for the classification of hyperspectral images. Among the destination and source domains, the most stable compact and discriminative feature subsets are chosen through the use of the novel Adaptive Mutation Quantum-inspired Squirrel Search Algorithm (AM-QSSA). Dataset shift and feature relevance are the two different terms taken for the objective function. The Light CERG Network is used for hyperspectral image classification and it also incorporates both deep learning models and tree-based ensemble models.

To avoid overfitting issues, the cross-validation approach has been utilized for creating the input, iteratively for a second-stage classifier.

In realistic scenarios, this dataset may be a physical system from which we want to retrieve information, such as in the readout of optical classical memories. The theoretical and experimental development of quantum reading has demonstrated that the readout of optical memories can be significantly enhanced through the use of quantum resources (namely, entangled input states) over that of the best classical strategies. However, the practicality of this quantum advantage hinges upon the scalability of quantum reading, and up to now its experimental demonstration has been limited to individual cells. In this work, we demonstrate quantum advantage at a fixed resource, namely, at fixed mean probe energy, in the multicell problem of pattern recognition. Through experimental realizations of digits from the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) handwritten digit dataset, and the application of advanced classical postprocessing, we report the use of entangled probe states and photon counting to achieve quantum advantage in classification error over that achieved with classical resources, confirming that the advantage gained through quantum sensors can be sustained throughout pattern recognition and complex postprocessing.

This study explores the application of quantum support vector machines (SVMs) on emotion recognition from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and compares its performance to traditional SVMs. SVMs are a popular machine-learning algorithm for this task due to their ability to handle high-dimensional data and non-linear relationships between input features. This study uses a quantum SVM to generate distinct solutions based on quantum principles. We applied this method to the DEAP benchmark dataset for binary class classification and gained new insights into the quantum nature of emotions. The algorithm has trained on D-Wave quantum annealer using various samples, achieving accuracies of 65.6% and 75.0% for valence and arousal dimensions, respectively, with 22 × 40 × 32 (subjects × trials × channels) data points, demonstrating the potential of quantum machine learning for EEG-based emotion recognition. However, there are methodological challenges due to the quantum arbitrariness of current annealers and the sensitivity of quantum-based machines to initial values. To address this, we conducted multiple investigations under similar circumstances and successfully recognized emotions using our proposed method. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Emotion recognition; Quantum machine learning; QUBO; SVM,,Article

Though described only by one-dimensional strings of binary cells evolving according to nearest-neighbour update rules, certain ECA rules manifest complex dynamics capable of universal computation. Yet, the classification of precisely which rules exhibit complex behaviour remains somewhat an open debate. Here, we approach this question using tools from quantum stochastic modelling, where quantum statistical memory—the memory required to model a stochastic process using a class of quantum machines—can be used to quantify the structure of a stochastic process. By viewing ECA rules as transformations of stochastic patterns, we ask: Does an ECA generate structure as quantified by the quantum statistical memory, and can this be used to identify complex cellular automata? We illustrate how the growth of this measure over time correctly distinguishes simple ECA from complex counterparts. Moreover, it provides a spectrum on which we can rank the complexity of ECA, by the rate at which they generate structure. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,,Article

Quantum models designed for tackling classification problems possess the potential to deliver speed enhancements and superior predictive accuracy compared to their classical counterparts. However, recent research has revealed that quantum neural networks (QNNs), akin to their classical deep neural network-based classifier counterparts, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In these attacks, meticulously designed perturbations added to clean input data can result in QNNs producing incorrect predictions with high confidence. To mitigate this issue, we suggest enhancing the adversarial robustness of quantum machine learning systems by incorporating noise layers into QNNs. This is accomplished by solving a Min-Max optimization problem to control the magnitude of the noise, thereby increasing the QNN’s resilience against adversarial attacks.

Multiple models have been developed to demonstrate the practical applications of the quantum properties. In this study, we first demonstrate that the previously proposed quanvolutional neural network (QuanvNN) using a randomly generated quantum circuit improves the image classification accuracy of a fully connected neural network against the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research 10 class (CIFAR-10) dataset from 92.0% to 93.0% and from 30.5% to 34.9%, respectively. We then propose a new model referred to as a Neural Network with Quantum Entanglement (NNQE) using a strongly entangled quantum circuit combined with Hadamard gates. The new model further improves the image classification accuracy of MNIST and CIFAR-10 to 93.8% and 36.0%, respectively. Unlike other QML methods, the proposed method does not require optimization of the parameters inside the quantum circuits; hence, it requires only limited use of the quantum circuit. Given the small number of qubits and relatively shallow depth of the proposed quantum circuit, the proposed method is well suited for implementation in noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. While promising results were obtained by the proposed method when applied to the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, a test against a more complicated German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset degraded the image classification accuracy from 82.2% to 73.4%. The exact causes of the performance improvement and degradation are currently an open question, prompting further research on the understanding and design of suitable quantum circuits for image classification neural networks for colored and complex data. © 2023 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; intelligent transportation system; quantum computer; quantum computing; quantum machine learning; traffic signs,Classification (of information); Image enhancement; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Statistical tests; Traffic signs; Classification accuracy; Images classification; Intelligent transportation systems; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Quanta computers; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Machine learning,Article

Quantum-inspired complex word embedding based on Hilbert space plays an important role in natural language processing (NLP), which fully leverages the similarity between quantum states and word tokens. A word containing multiple meanings could correspond to a single quantum particle which may exist in several possible states, and a sentence could be analogous to the quantum system where particles interfere with each other. Motivated by quantum-inspired complex word embedding, interpretable complex-valued word embedding (ICWE) is proposed to design two end-to-end quantum-inspired deep neural networks (ICWE-QNN and CICWE-QNN representing convolutional complex-valued neural network based on ICWE) for binary text classification. They have the proven feasibility and effectiveness in the application of NLP and can solve the problem of text information loss in CE-Mix [1] model caused by neglecting the important linguistic features of text, since linguistic feature extraction is presented in our model with deep learning algorithms, in which gated recurrent unit (GRU) extracts the sequence information of sentences, attention mechanism makes the model focus on important words in sentences and convolutional layer captures the local features of projected matrix. The model ICWE-QNN can avoid random combination of word tokens and CICWE-QNN fully considers textual features of the projected matrix. Experiments conducted on five benchmarking classification datasets demonstrate our proposed models have higher accuracy than the compared traditional models including CaptionRep BOW, DictRep BOW and Paragram-Phrase, and they also have great performance on F1-score. Eespecially, CICWE-QNN model has higher accuracy than the quantum-inspired model CE-Mix as well for four datasets including SST, SUBJ, CR and MPQA.

In this paper, we propose an evolutionary-based quantum architecture search (EQAS) scheme for the optimal layout to balance the higher expressive power and the trainable ability. In our EQAS, each layout of quantum circuits, i.e., quantum circuit architecture (QCA), is first encoded into a binary string, also called genes. Next, an algorithm is designed to remove the redundant parameters in QCA according to the eigenvalues of the corresponding quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM). Later, the fitness values of the QCAs are calculated by evaluating the performance of QCAs and are processed with softmax function so that the sum of all fitness values is to 1, and it is used as the probabilities to prepare the parent generation by the Roulette Wheel selection strategy. After that, the mutation and crossover are applied to obtain the next generation. EQAS is verified by the classification task in quantum machine learning over three datasets. The results show that the proposed EQAS can search for the optimal QCA with fewer parameterized gate. And higher accuracies are also obtained by using the proposed EQAS for the classification tasks over the three datasets. Overall, EQAS presents a promising way in quantum architecture search, by taking advantage of QFIM and the evolutionary algorithm. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Evolutionary scheme; Quantum architecture search; Quantum Fisher information,Classification (of information); Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Evolutionary algorithms; Quantum optics; Timing circuits; Circuit architectures; Classification tasks; Evolutionary scheme; Fisher information; Fisher information matrices; Fitness values; Quantum architecture; Quantum architecture search; Quantum circuit; Quantum fisher information; Fisher information matrix,Article

The quantum support vector machine was proposed to improve the performance, in which the Swap Test plays a crucial role in realizing the classification. However, as the Swap Test is destructive, the quantum support vector machine must be repeated in preparing qubits and manipulating operations. This paper proposes a quantum support vector machine based on the amplitude estimation (AE-QSVM) which gets rid of the constraint of repetitive process and saves the quantum resources. At first, a generalized quantum amplitude estimation is introduced in which the initial state can be arbitrary instead of being |0〉. Then, AE-QSVM is trained by the quantum singular value decomposition and a query sample is classified by the generalized quantum amplitude estimation. In AE-QSVM, a high accuracy can be achieved by adding auxiliary qubits instead of repeating the algorithm. The time and space complexity of AE-QSVM are reduced compared with other algorithms.

Experiments conducted on the MNIST dataset and the Fashion-MNIST dataset demonstrate that the QCNN achieves faster convergence speed and higher image classification accuracy than the classical convolutional neural networks. Specifically, the QCNN reaches convergence after just 50 iterations, whereas the classical counterpart requires more than 200 iterations to converge. Furthermore, when performing the PCA dimensionality reduction to 8, the QCNN with Circuit 6 achieves an accuracy of 98.54% on the MNIST dataset, while the classical counterpart achieves only 86.32%. © 2023",Image classification; Pure variational quantum circuits; Quantum convolutional neural network; Quantum machine learning; Tree-structured hybrid amplitude encoding,Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Encoding (symbols); Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Network coding; Quantum computers; Timing circuits; Convolutional neural network; Encodings; Images classification; Machine-learning; Pure variational quantum circuit; Quantum circuit; Quantum convolutional neural network; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Tree-structured; Tree-structured hybrid amplitude encoding; Image classification,Article

We propose transfer learning as an effective strategy for utilizing small QCNNs in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era to the full extent. In the classical-to-quantum transfer learning framework, a QCNN can solve complex classification problems without requiring a large-scale quantum circuit by utilizing a pre-trained classical convolutional neural network (CNN).

The pursuit of quantum advantage in quantum machine learning is an active area of research. For current noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, various quantum-classical hybrid algorithms have been proposed. One such previously proposed hybrid algorithm is a gate-based variational embedding classifier, which is composed of a classical neural network and a parameterized gate-based quantum circuit. We propose a quantum variational embedding classifier based on an analog quantum computer, where control signals vary continuously in time: our particular focus is an implementation using quantum annealers. In our algorithm, the classical data are transformed into the parameters of the time-varying Hamiltonian of the analog quantum computer by a linear transformation. The nonlinearity needed for a nonlinear classification problem is purely provided by the analog quantum computer through the nonlinear dependence of the final quantum state on the control parameters of the Hamiltonian. We perform numerical simulations that demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm for performing binary and multiclass classification on linearly inseparable datasets such as concentric circles and MNIST digits. Our classifier can reach accuracy comparable with that of the best classical classifiers. We find that the performance of our classifier can be increased by increasing the number of qubits, until the performance saturates and fluctuates. Moreover, the number of optimization parameters of our classifier scales linearly with the number of qubits. The increase of the number of training parameters when the size of our model increases is therefore not as fast as that of a neural network. Our algorithm presents the possibility of using current quantum annealers for solving practical machine-learning problems, and it could also be useful to explore quantum advantage in quantum machine learning. © 2023 American Physical Society.

In this study, we investigated the performance of variational quantum, quantum-enhanced support vector, and hypergraph case-based reasoning classifiers in the binary classification of EEG data from a P300 experiment. On the one hand, quantum classification is a promising technology to reduce computational time and improve learning outcomes. On the other hand, case-based reasoning has an excellent potential to simplify the preprocessing steps of EEG analysis. We found that the balanced training (prediction) accuracy of each of these three classifiers was 56.95 (51.83), 83.17 (50.25), and 71.10% (52.04%), respectively. In addition, case-based reasoning performed significantly lower with a simplified (49.78%) preprocessing pipeline. These results demonstrated that all classifiers were able to learn from the data and that quantum classification of EEG data was implementable; however, more research is required to enable a greater prediction accuracy because none of the classifiers were able to generalize from the data.

In this work, we propose several general-purpose optimization methods and best practices designed to enhance the practical usefulness of fidelity-based quantum classification algorithms. Specifically, we first describe a data pre-processing strategy that, by preserving the relevant relationships between data points when processed through quantum feature maps, substantially alleviates the effect of kernel concentration on structured datasets. We also introduce a classical post-processing method that, based on standard fidelity measures estimated on a quantum processor, yields non-linear decision boundaries in the feature Hilbert space, thus achieving the quantum counterpart of the radial basis functions technique that is widely employed in classical kernel methods.

This paper proposes a method for designing parameterized quantum circuits based on specific Pauli axis. By obtaining the prior information of the coding strategy, using the rotational characteristics of the quantum gate to reasonably combine the quantum gate and efficiently realize the classification task on a specific Pauli axis, it can reduce the amount of parameters in the variational quantum circuit.

When a machine learning model is consecutively trained on multiple tasks that come in sequence, its performance on previously learned tasks may drop dramatically during the learning process of the newly seen task. To avoid this phenomenon termed catastrophic forgetting, continual learning, also known as lifelong learning, has been proposed and become one of the most up-to-date research areas of machine learning. As quantum machine learning blossoms in recent years, it is interesting to develop quantum continual learning. This paper focuses on the case of quantum models for quantum data where the computation model and the data to be processed are both quantum. The gradient episodic memory method is incorporated to design a quantum continual learning scheme that overcomes catastrophic forgetting and realizes knowledge backward transfer. Specifically, a sequence of quantum state classification tasks is continually learned by a variational quantum classifier whose parameters are optimized by a classical gradient-based optimizer. The gradient of the current task is projected to the closest gradient, avoiding the increase of the loss at previous tasks, but allowing the decrease. Numerical simulation results show that our scheme not only overcomes catastrophic forgetting, but also realize knowledge backward transfer, which means the classifier's performance on previous tasks is enhanced rather than compromised while learning a new task. © 2023",Continual learning; Quantum machine learning; Variational quantum algorithm,Knowledge management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Quantum theory; AI systems; Catastrophic forgetting; Continual learning; Human level intelligence; Machine-learning; Quantum algorithms; Quantum data; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Variational quantum algorithm; Machine learning,Article

A solution to potentially overcome the problem of the BP has recently been proposed by Cerezo et al In this solution, it is shown that, for an arbitrary deep quantum layer(s) in QNNs, a global cost function (all qubits measured in an n-qubit system) will always experience BP, whereas a local cost function (single qubit measured in an n-qubit system) can help to alleviate the problem of BP to a certain depth ( )). In this paper, we empirically analyze the locality and globality of the cost function in hybrid quantum neural networks. We consider two application scenarios namely, binary and multi-class classification, and show that for multiclass classification, the local cost function setting does not follow the claims of Cerezo et al; that is, the local cost function does not result in an extended quantum layer’s depth. We also show that for multiclass classification, the overall performance in terms of accuracy for the global cost function setting is significantly higher than the local cost function setting. On the other hand, for binary classification, our results show that the local cost function setting follows the claims of Cerezo et al, and results in an extended depth of quantum layers.

The hot spot regions from the thermograms were segmented using a color-based k-means clustering technique. The features from the segmented hot spot region were extracted using different feature extraction methods. Finally, normal and RA groups were categorized using LogitBoost, Bagging, and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The proposed study used two testing methods, such as 10-fold cross-validation and a percentage split of 80–20%. The LogitBoost classifier outperformed with an accuracy of 93.75% using the 10-fold cross-validation technique compared to other classifiers. Also, the quantum support vector machine (QSVM) obtained a prediction accuracy of 92.7%. Furthermore, the QSVM model reduces the computational cost and training time of the model to classify the RA and normal subjects. Thus, thermograms with classical machine learning and quantum machine learning algorithms could be considered a feasible technique for classifying normal and RA groups. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",LogitBoost; Quantum support vector machine; Rheumatoid arthritis; Thermograms,"Algorithms; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Hand; Humans; Machine Learning; Thermography; accuracy; Article; cross validation; feature extraction; human; image segmentation; k means clustering; learning algorithm; machine learning; prediction; quantum mechanics; receiver operating characteristic; rheumatoid arthritis; scale invariant feature transform; support vector machine; thermography; algorithm; diagnostic imaging; hand; machine learning",Article

It is a powerful formalism to represent both the quantum and classical uncertainty of quantum systems and to express different statistical operations such as measurement, system combination and expectations as linear algebra operations. This paper explores how density matrices can be used as a building block for machine learning models exploiting their ability to straightforwardly combine linear algebra and probability. One of the main results of the paper is to show that density matrices coupled with random Fourier features could approximate arbitrary probability distributions over Rn. Based on this finding the paper builds different models for density estimation, classification and regression. These models are differentiable, so it is possible to integrate them with other differentiable components, such as deep learning architectures and to learn their parameters using gradient-based optimization. In addition, the paper presents optimization-less training strategies based on estimation and model averaging.

In this work, we propose a novel variational algorithm for quantum Single Layer Perceptron (qSLP) which allows producing a quantum state equivalent to the output of a classical single-layer neural network. In particular, the proposed qSLP generates an exponentially large number of parametrized linear combinations in superposition that can be learnt using quantum-classical optimization. As a consequence, the number of hidden neurons scales exponentially with the number of qubits and, thanks to the universal approximation theorem, our algorithm opens to the possibility of approximating any function on quantum computers. Thus, the proposed approach produces a model with substantial descriptive power and widens the horizon of potential applications using near-term quantum computation, especially those related to quantum machine learning. Finally, we test the qSLP as a classification model against two different quantum models on two different real-world datasets usually adopted for benchmarking classical algorithms. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Machine learning; Neural networks; Quantum computing; Quantum machine learning,Approximation algorithms; Classification (of information); Computation theory; Learning algorithms; Multilayer neural networks; Network layers; Quantum optics; Qubits; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum-classical; Single-layer perceptrons; Variational algorithms; Machine learning,Conference paper

There are, however, two main challenges regardless of the promised quantum advantage. Currently available quantum bits (qubits) are very small in number, whereas real-world datasets are characterized by hundreds of high-dimensional elements (i.e., features). In addition, there is not a single unified approach for embedding real-world high-dimensional datasets in a limited number of qubits. Some real-world datasets are too small for training intricate QML networks. Hence, to tackle these two challenges for benchmarking and validating QML networks on real-world, small, and high-dimensional datasets in one go, we employ quantum transfer learning comprising a classical VGG16 layer and a multiqubit QML layer. We use real-amplitude and strongly-entangling N-layer QML networks with and without data reuploading layers as a multiqubit QML layer, and evaluate their expressive power quantified by using their local effective dimension and the lower local effective dimension of a QML network, the better its performance on unseen data. As datasets, we utilize Eurosat and synthetic datasets (i.e., easy-to-classify datasets), and an UC Merced Land use dataset (i.e., a hard-to-classify dataset). Our numerical results show that the strongly-entangling N-layer QML network has a lower local effective dimension than the real-amplitude QML network and outperforms it on the hard-to-classify datasets.

Recent works show that quantum computers can efficiently construct a model of a classifier by engineering the quantum interference effect to carry out the kernel evaluation in parallel. For practical applications of these quantum machine learning methods, an important issue is to minimize the size of quantum circuits. We present the simplest quantum circuit for constructing a kernel-based binary classifier. This is achieved by generalizing the interference circuit to encode data labels in the relative phases of the quantum state and by introducing compact amplitude encoding, which encodes two training data vectors into one quantum register. When compared to the simplest known quantum binary classifier, the number of qubits is reduced by two and the number of steps is reduced linearly with respect to the number of training data. The two-qubit measurement with post-selection required in the previous method is simplified to single-qubit measurement. Furthermore, the final quantum state has a smaller amount of entanglement than that of the previous method, which advocates the cost-effectiveness of our method. Our design also provides a straightforward way to handle an imbalanced data set, which is often encountered in many machine learning problems.  © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.",entanglement; kernel method; quantum classifier; quantum computing; quantum machine learning,Classification (of information); Cost effectiveness; Encoding (symbols); Quantum entanglement; Quantum interference devices; Quantum optics; Qubits; Binary classifiers; Entanglement; Kernel-methods; Machine learning methods; Machine-learning; Quantum circuit; Quantum classifier; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Machine learning,Article

Using neural networks as analogies for physical systems is an important part of quantum machine learning. This paper summarizes the CIFAR-10 dataset. For the dataset, “five training batches and one testing batch” are used to divide the ten thousand photographs. One thousand images from each class are randomly selected for inclusion in the test batch. Even though each batch comprises all of the remaining photographs, some batches have a greater number of images from a particular category.

Third-party libraries such as PyTorch, Qiskit, and matplotlib are frequently loaded into the program.

From a dataset of n sequences, a phylogenetic tree of (2n-5)!! possible topologies exists, and determining the optimum topology using brute force is infeasible. Recently, a recursive graph cut on a graph-represented-similarity matrix has proven accurate in reconstructing a phylogenetic tree containing distantly related sequences. However, identifying the optimum graph cut is challenging, and approximate solutions are currently utilized. Here, a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed with an improved graph cut using a quantum-inspired computer, the Fujitsu Digital Annealer (DA), and the algorithm was named the “Normalized-Minimum cut by Digital Annealer (NMcutDA) method”. First, a criterion for the graph cut, the normalized cut value, was compared with existing clustering methods. Based on the cut, we verified that the simulated phylogenetic tree could be reconstructed with the highest accuracy when sequences were diverged. Moreover, for some actual data from the structure-based protein classification database, only NMcutDA could cluster sequences into correct superfamilies. Conclusively, NMcutDA reconstructed better phylogenetic trees than those using other methods by optimizing the graph cut. We anticipate that when the diversity of sequences is sufficiently high, NMcutDA can be utilized with high efficiency. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Distance-matrix method; Graph cut; Phylogenetic reconstruction; Quantum-inspired computing,"Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Computers; Databases, Protein; Phylogeny; algorithm; cluster analysis; computer; phylogeny; protein database",Article

The user is required to input the PubChem Compound ID (CID) of the compound the user wishes to gain information about its predicted biological activity and the tool outputs the RCSB PDB IDs of the predicted drug target interaction for the input CID. Further the tool also optimizes the compound of interest of the user toward drug likeness properties through a deep learning based structure optimization protocol. The tool also incorporates a feature to perform automated In Silico modelling to find the interaction between the compounds and the predicted drug targets to uncover their protein-ligand interaction profiles.

A key issue is how to address the inherent nonlinearity of classical deep learning, a problem in the quantum domain due to the fact that the composition of an arbitrary number of quantum gates, consisting of a series of sequential unitary transformations, is intrinsically linear. This problem has been variously approached in literature, principally via the introduction of measurements between layers of unitary transformations. In this article, we introduce the quantum path kernel (QPK), a formulation of quantum machine learning capable of replicating those aspects of deep machine learning typically associated with superior generalization performance in the classical domain, specifically, hierarchical feature learning. Our approach generalizes the notion of quantum neural tangent kernel, which has been used to study the dynamics of classical and quantum machine learning models. The QPK exploits the parameter trajectory, i.e., the curve delineated by model parameters as they evolve during training, enabling the representation of differential layerwise convergence behaviors, or the formation of hierarchical parametric dependencies, in terms of their manifestation in the gradient space of the predictor function. We evaluate our approach with respect to variants of the classification of Gaussian xor mixtures: an artificial but emblematic problem that intrinsically requires multilevel learning in order to achieve optimal class separation. © 2020 IEEE.",Machine learning; neural tangent kernel (NTK); quantum kernel; quantum machine learning; quantum neural networks (QNNs); support vector machine (SVM),Deep neural networks; Job analysis; Linear transformations; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Deep learning; Kernel; Machine-learning; Neural tangent kernel; Quantum Computing; Quantum kernel; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum neural networks; Quantum system; Representation learning; Support vector machine; Support vectors machine; Task analysis; Support vector machines,Article

The ranking is carried out through the classification or clustering of processed results which can include redundant and noisy features. The accuracy of classification or clusters for the ranking process can be maximized by removing noisy and duplicate features through the feature selection method. Although feature selection is an expensive computational process, after many decades, quantum computation tools are in use for many algorithms to implement realistic problems, particularly in the standard of Quantum Annealing.

It maps the data from the high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space, especially a two-dimensional plane, while maintaining the relationship or similarities between the surrounding points. In t-SNE, the initial position of the low-dimensional data is randomly determined, and the visualization is achieved by moving the low-dimensional data to minimize a cost function. Its variant called parametric t-SNE uses neural networks for this mapping. In this paper, we propose to use quantum neural networks for parametric t-SNE to reflect the characteristics of high-dimensional quantum data on low-dimensional data. We use fidelity-based metrics instead of Euclidean distance in calculating high-dimensional data similarity. To verify our proposed method, we visualize both classical (Iris dataset) and quantum (time-depending Hamiltonian dynamics) data for classification tasks. Since this method allows us to represent a quantum dataset in a higher dimensional Hilbert space by a quantum dataset in a lower dimension while keeping their similarity, the proposed method can also be used to compress quantum data for further quantum machine learning. © 2022 authors.

In this study, Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), a quantum-based machine learning algorithm, is compared with classical machine learning algorithms. IBM-Studies on quantum computer simulation have been carried out. The data dimension is reduced by first applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the dataset. Afterwards, analyzes were made and the results were presented comparatively. The highest performance of the QSVM algorithm was obtained at 92.3%. Compared to classical machine learning algorithms, the performance of the QSVM algorithm is slightly lower. It is thought that higher performance and speed will be achieved in QSVM by eliminating limitations such as limited qubit resources and system restrictions.

Particularly, a quantum feature map could provide a promising alternative kernel to enhance a Support Vector Classifier (SVC). While there are very few existing guiding principles to design a high performing feature map, a quantum circuit family called the Pauli feature map is arguably known to behave well. The family is characterized by the occurrence of Pauli gates on the quantum circuits, while it still has several tunable parameters whose optimal values are sensitive to the nature of the datasets. In this work, we present an automatic generation of such feature map using the Genetic Algorithm (GA), aiming to maximize the accuracy of the model while keeping the circuit as simple as possible. We applied the approach to both synthetic and real datasets. The resulting classification metrics and best circuits are discussed in comparison with several classical and quantum kernel baselines. In general, the GA-generated feature maps perform better than other baselines. Moreover, the results show that the evolutionary circuits tend to differ among various datasets, which signify the usability of this generic scheme to determine the best customized quantum feature map for a specific dataset. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Pairwise classification can be used to predict relationships among data and is used for problems such as link prediction and chemical interaction prediction. However, in pairwise classification using a Kronecker kernel, it is very costly to calculate the Kronecker product of the kernel matrices when there is a large amount of data. We found that the Kronecker product of kernel matrices can be represented more efficiently in time and space in quantum computing than that in classical computing. We also found that a pairwise classifier can be effectively trained by applying the HHL-based quantum support vector machine algorithm to the Kronecker kernel matrix. In an experiment comparing a classical algorithm with a quantum support vector machine with a Kronecker kernel run on a quantum computing simulator, the misclassification rate of the latter was almost the same as that of the former for the same pairwise classification problem in some cases. This indicates that a quantum support vector machine with a Kronecker kernel algorithm can achieve accuracy equivalent to that of the classical algorithm more efficiently and scalably.

Considering that the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm is difficult to solve the ELM parameters on near-term quantum devices, we adopt a variational framework to facilitate implementation on the near-term noisy intermediate scale quantum computer. On both classification and regression tasks, our proposed method outperforms classical ELM in classical simulations. Moreover, the classification tasks achieved on IBM quantum simulator also show comparable classification accuracy. The final analysis shows that our proposed algorithm has an exponential improvement over classical ones for high-dimensional data processing, and is a powerful application of quantum machine learning on near-term quantum devices. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Extreme learning machine; Quantum neural network; Variational quantum algorithm,Clustering algorithms; Knowledge acquisition; Learning algorithms; Mathematical transformations; Metadata; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Extreme learning machine; Feature space; Generalization performance; Learning machines; Process data; Quantum algorithms; Quantum device; Quantum neural networks; Training speed; Variational quantum algorithm; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; classification algorithm; data processing; finite element analysis; gray matter; human; learning; learning algorithm; machine learning; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; mathematical parameters; nerve cell network; quantitative structure activity relation; quantum mechanics; simulation; support vector machine; theory; training; Machine learning,Article

We develop a technique that takes advantage of a quantum-classical hybrid infrastructure called Quantum-Enhanced Codecs (QEC). We evaluate a (1) purely classical, (2) hybrid kernel, and (3) purely quantum classifier for video QoD congestion classification, where congestion is either low, medium or high, using QoD measurements from a real networking test-bed. Findings show that the SVC performs the classification task 4% better in the low congestion state and the kernel method performs 6.1% and 10.1% better for the medium and high congestion states. Empirical evidence suggests that when the SVC is trained on a very low amount of data, the classification accuracy varies significantly depending on the quality of the training data, however, the variance in classification accuracy of quantum models is significantly lower. Classical video QoD classifiers benefit from the quantum data embedding techniques. They learn better decision regions using less training data.  © 2023 IEEE.",Jitter; Machine Learning; Quality of Deliv-ery; Quality of Service; Quantum Machine Learning,Classification (of information); Jitter; Quantum theory; Support vector machines; Classification accuracy; Machine-learning; Quality of deliv-ery; Quality-of-service; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Support vector classifiers; Training data; Video quality; Quality of service,Conference paper

In this work, we improve the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by utilizing the quantum-inspired way of data representation and convolutional operation. Specifically, we first improve the quantum-inspired neuron by exploiting the complex-valued weights, which have richer representational capacity and better non-linearity. Moreover, we extend the method implementing the quantum-inspired neurons to perform convolutional operations, and naturally draw the models of quantum-inspired convolutional neural networks (QICNNs) capable of processing high-dimensional data. Here five specific types of QICNNs are proposed, which are different in the way of implementing the convolutional layers and fully connected layers. We establish the detail mathematical framework to implement the QICNNs. The performances of accuracy, convergence and robustness of the five QICNNs against the classical counterpart are tested using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results show that (1) the QICNN can achieve higher classification accuracy (up to 99.65%) than the classical CNN when using the MNIST dataset; (2) the QICNN has faster convergence speed, which means that QICNN can be trained easily than classical CNN when they have a similar number of parameters; (3) the QICNN has better robustness in the case of employing different way of weight initialization or rotating the input data.

We aimed to develop a lightweight machine learning model for diagnosing fibromyalgia using single-lead ECG signals recorded during sleep. We analyzed 139 single-lead ECGs recorded during Stage 2 and Sleep Stage 3 of 16 patients with fibromyalgia and 16 age and sex matched controls. ECG records were divided into 15-second segments: 3308 and 1783 in healthy vs fibromyalgia classes, respectively. Our model comprised (1) feature extraction that combined an 8-wavelet filter and 4-level multiple filters-based multilevel discrete wavelet transform signal decomposition with a novel local binary pattern (LBP)-like function, 3LBP, that generated multiple patterns (analogous to quantum superposition) for feature map value extraction (the optimal input-specific pattern was dynamically selected using a novel forward-forward algorithm); (2) feature selection using neighborhood component analysis and Chi-square functions; (3) classification with k-nearest neighbors and support vector machine classifiers using leave-one-record-out cross-validation; and (4) mode function-based iterative majority voting to generate voted results, from which the best model result was derived. Our model attained binary classification accuracies of 93.87% and 92.02% for Sleep Stage 2 and Sleep Stage 3, respectively. The observed outcomes and empirical evidence unequivocally demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed methodology in differentiating the electrocardiographic signatures of fibromyalgia patients from control subjects. The model exhibited self-organizational properties and computational efficiency, rendering it amenable to facile clinical integration.  © 2013 IEEE.",3LBP; ECG-based fibromyalgia detection; leave-one-record-out cross-validation; multiple filters-based multilevel discrete wavelet transform; quantum-based feature extraction,Bandpass filters; Biomedical signal processing; Discrete wavelet transforms; Electrocardiography; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Extraction; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Local binary pattern; Nearest neighbor search; Quantum theory; Signal reconstruction; Sleep research; Wavelet decomposition; 3LBP; Cross validation; Discrete-wavelet-transform; Electrocardiography-based fibromyalgia detection; Features extraction; Filter-based; Leave-one-record-out cross-validation; Multilevels; Multiple filter-based multilevel discrete wavelet transform; Quantum-based feature extraction; Feature extraction,Article

This paper explores the use of quantum machine learning for electroencephalogram (EEG) classification. In particular, a previously proposed EEG feature extraction method and classification framework for classifying dementia subjects were followed in this study. A quantum classifier replaced the classical classifier component of the framework, and the classification accuracies between the quantum and classical classifiers were compared. This study has demonstrated that applying QML in healthy-dementia classification can be implemented using near-term quantum devices or quantum simulators with moderate performance. The quantum classifier achieved an overall classification accuracy of 81.67% and 79.17% in a train-test split performance test and an n × k-fold cross-validation test, respectively. However, the quantum approach did not produce higher classification accuracies than the classical classifier. Despite the promise of quantum advantages, further investigation and optimization are required to improve its effectiveness. © 2023 IEEE.",dementia classification; EEG classification; quantum machine learning,Classification (of information); Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Neurodegenerative diseases; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Classification accuracy; Dementia classification; Electroencephalogram classification; Feature extraction methods; Learning tasks; Machine-learning; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Electroencephalography,Conference paper

For example, in quantum machine learning, a special type of quantum circuit called a quantum neural network is one of the most investigated approaches. However, we know little about suitable circuit architectures or important model hyperparameters for a given task. In this work, we apply the functional ANOVA framework to the quantum neural network architectures to analyze which of the quantum machine learning hyperparameters are most influential for their predictive performance. We restrict our study to 7 open-source datasets from the OpenML-CC18 classification benchmark, which are small enough for simulations on quantum hardware with fewer than 20 qubits. Using this framework, three main levels of importance were identified, confirming expected patterns and revealing new insights. For instance, the learning rate is identified as the most important hyperparameter on all datasets, whereas the particular choice of entangling gates used is found to be the least important on all except for one dataset. In addition to identifying the relevant hyperparameters, for each of them, we also learned data-driven priors based on values that perform well on previously seen datasets, which can then be used to steer hyperparameter optimization processes. We utilize these priors in the hyperparameter optimization method hyperband and show that these improve performance against uniform sampling across all datasets by, on average, 0.53 % , up to 6.11 % , in cross-validation accuracy. We also demonstrate that such improvements hold on average regardless of the configuration hyperband is run with.

In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of generalization performance in QML after training on a limited number N of training data points. We show that the generalization error of a quantum machine learning model with T trainable gates scales at worst as T/N. When only K ≪ T gates have undergone substantial change in the optimization process, we prove that the generalization error improves to K/N. Our results imply that the compiling of unitaries into a polynomial number of native gates, a crucial application for the quantum computing industry that typically uses exponential-size training data, can be sped up significantly. We also show that classification of quantum states across a phase transition with a quantum convolutional neural network requires only a very small training data set. Other potential applications include learning quantum error correcting codes or quantum dynamical simulation.

Automated retinal diagnosis from the Retinal fundus images aid in the early detection of many pathological conditions. The low-level statistical features used in literatures have not provided the complete ROP-specific profile, and hence it has to be replaced by high-level features. The proposed system involves extracting Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) - Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) combined high-level features from the SegNet segmented retinal vessels and classified using the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) classifier. This study aims (i) to segment retinal vessels from the acquired fundus images using SegNet and extract their features using the SURF and SIFT Feature Extraction method, (ii) to classify the Normal and ROP retinal vessels using four classical machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Reduced Error Pruning (REP) tree, K-Star, and LogitBoost and Quantum SVM classifier, (iii) to develop a novel transformer-based Swin-T ROP model to classify ROP from normal Neonatal fundus images, (iv) to compare the performance characteristics of the proposed QSVM model with the Resnet50, DarkNet19, and classical machine learning classifiers. The study is conducted using 200 fundus images, including 100 normal and 100 ROP-positive neonatal retinal images. The machine learning classifiers such as SVM, REP Tree, K-Star, and Logit Boost Classifiers attained accuracy of 86.7%, 75%, 74%, and 76.5%, respectively, in classifying ROP from normal retinal images. The deep learning networks such as ResNet50 and DarkNet19 classified ROP from normal fundus images with an accuracy of 92.87% and 89%, respectively. The Quantum machine learning classifier outperforms the classical machine learning classifiers, Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and SwinT-ROP in terms of classification accuracy (95.5%), sensitivity (93%), and specificity (98%). The proposed system accurately diagnoses ROP from the neonatal fundus images and could be used in point-of-care diagnosis to access diagnostic expertise in underserved regions. © 2013 IEEE.",QSVM; quantum classifier; retinal image processing; transfer learning; transformer,Deep learning; Diagnosis; Extraction; Eye protection; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image segmentation; Neural networks; Ophthalmology; Stars; Features extraction; Images processing; Images segmentations; Machine-learning; Quantum classifier; Quantum support vector machine; Retinal image; Retinal image processing; Retinal vessels; Sensitivity; Support vectors machine; Transfer learning; Transformer; Support vector machines,Article

Classical data is transformed to the quantum Hilbert space using an embedding scheme and the VQC performs quantum operations on this transformed quantum data using parametric quantum gates. In this work, we present a new embedding scheme using Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) that takes address as input, and gives data as the output similar to a classical Random Access Memory (RAM). We propose a basic circuit-based QRAM architecture and its application in, (a) storage for ML usage and, (b) storage of binary data. For ML, we store images of digits dataset into the QRAM and perform binary classification using a Quantum Neural Network (QNN). We observe that QNN driven by the proposed QRAM converges faster (at 6th epoch) with 100% classification accuracy compared to QNN with normal embedding and classical Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) setups which converge with same accuracy at around 10th and 15th epochs, respectively. We obtain ≈ 63\% classification accuracy on real hardware from IBM. For storage of binary data, we measure Hamming Distance (HD) and percentage correct predictions for quality evaluation of the proposed QRAM. We observe that the HD and percentage correct predictions worsens as the number of address lines increases. We propose two techniques to improve the QRAM accuracy namely, (i) clustering of raw data and allocating one QRAM per cluster and, (ii) bit splitting to divide wider data into smaller chunks and allocating one QRAM per split. Clustering provides best results by improving the HD for 9-address QRAM by ≈ 1.95\X than pure QRAM and ≈ 1.74X improvement compared to bit-split (which provides ≈ 1.11X improvement than pure QRAM). © 2013 IEEE.",classification; machine learning; Quantum RAM,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computation theory; Learning systems; Logic gates; Memory architecture; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Random access storage; Timing circuits; Binary data; Classification accuracy; Embeddings; Machine-learning; Quantum circuit; Quantum neural networks; Quantum random access memory; Random access memory; Hamming distance,Article

The quantum K-nearest neighbor (QKNN) algorithm can handle the above problem with satisfactory efficiency; however, its accuracy is sacrificed when directly applying the traditional similarity measure based on Euclidean distance. Inspired by the Polar coordinate system and the quantum property, this work proposes a new similarity measure to replace the Euclidean distance, which is defined as Polar distance. Polar distance considers both angular and module length information, introducing a weight parameter adjusted to the specific application data. To validate the efficiency of Polar distance, we conducted various experiments using several typical datasets. For the conventional KNN algorithm, the accuracy performance is comparable when using Polar distance for similarity measurement, while for the QKNN algorithm, it significantly outperforms the Euclidean distance in terms of classification accuracy.

Optimizing current power generation and transmission to reduce energy consumption, cost, and other factors is equally vital to upgrading methods for effectively harvesting renewable energy. However, it gets more challenging for conventional computers to perform optimization as the number of factors affecting power generation and transmission rises. Extreme environmental cases will consequently lead to the imperfect functioning of IoT systems. By utilizing quantum-mechanical properties, such as superposition and entanglement, quantum computers can computationally outperform classical computers while consuming much less energy. In this paper, we investigate various quantum machine learning algorithms on two datasets (TWTDUS and SDWTT18) related to IoT extreme environment and study the effect of a noisy quantum environment. We observe that for the TWTDUS dataset, the variational UU&#x2020; with analytical clustering methods achieves the highest accuracy of 98.10%. Similarly, for the SDWTT18 dataset, the UU&#x2020; method with k-Means clustering achieves an accuracy of 94.43%.

Its impact extends beyond enhancing the classification capabilities of learning algorithms; it also enables the reduction of dataset dimensionality. Consequently, feature selection entails a multi-objective optimization problem, striving to minimize the number of features while maximizing classification accuracy. Surprisingly, there are only a few studies that approach feature selection from a multi-objective perspective, compared to the more prevalent single-objective viewpoint.Motivated by this gap, we present a novel multi-objective algorithm for tackling the feature selection problem. Our approach draws inspiration from quantum computing and combines the strengths of the Firefly Algorithm (FA) and the Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO). Leveraging quantum computing enhances solution distribution, while the cooperative nature of FA and PSO facilitates effective exploration of the feature space. Additionally, we introduce two fixed-size external archives, dedicated to storing the best solutions. The archive sizes are controlled using the epsilon dominance relation. We evaluate the efficiency of our algorithm through an extensive comparison against both single and multi-objective feature selection algorithms that enjoy high regard in the field.

By removing the limitations of quantum computers and making changes in the hyperparameters of quantum-based algorithms, the use of quantum-based machine learning methods in the classification of EEG data can provide better results in terms of accuracy and runtime. © 2023 IEEE.",EEG; machine learning algorithm; quantum machine learning; quantum support vector machine,Biomedical signal processing; Brain computer interface; Classification (of information); Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Principal component analysis; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Support vector machines; Electroencephalogram signals; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning methods; Machine-learning; Performance; Powered support; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum support vector machine; Support vectors machine; Electroencephalography,Conference paper

Here we propose a quantum machine learning approach based on quantum convolutional neural networks for solving the multiclass classification problem. The corresponding learning procedure is implemented via TensorFlowQuantum as a hybrid quantum-classical (variational) model, where quantum output results are fed to the softmax activation function with the subsequent minimization of the cross entropy loss via optimizing the parameters of the quantum circuit. Our conceptional improvements here include a new model for a quantum perceptron and an optimized structure of the quantum circuit. We use the proposed approach to solve a 4-class classification problem for the case of the MNIST dataset using eight qubits for data encoding and four ancilla qubits; previous results have been obtained for 3-class classification problems. Our results show that accuracies of our solution are similar to classical convolutional neural networks with comparable numbers of trainable parameters. We expect that our finding provide a new step towards the use of quantum neural networks for solving relevant problems in the NISQ era and beyond.

Very few works applied QML to EO tasks, and none of them explored a methodology that can give guidelines on the hyperparameter tuning of the quantum part for land cover classification (LCC). As a first step in the direction of quantum advantage for RS data classification, this letter opens new research lines, allowing us to demonstrate that there are more convenient solutions to simply increasing the number of qubits in the quantum part. To pave the first steps for researchers interested in the above, the structure of a new hybrid quantum neural network (QNN) for EO data and LCC is proposed with a strategy to choose the number of qubits to find the most efficient combination in terms of both system complexity and results accuracy. We sampled and tried a number of configurations, and using the suggested method, we came up with the most efficient solution (in terms of the selected metrics). Better performance is achieved with less model complexity when tested and compared with SOTA and standard techniques for identifying volcanic eruptions chosen as a case study. Additionally, the method makes the model more resilient to dataset imbalance, a significant problem when training classical models.

However, the integration of quantum computing and machine learning poses several challenges. One of the prominent challenges lies in the presence of barren plateaus (BP) in QML algorithms, particularly in quantum neural networks (QNNs). Recent studies have successfully identified the fundamental causes underlying the existence of BP in QNNs. This paper presents a framework designed to explore the interplay of multiple factors contributing to the BP problem in quantum neural networks (QNNs), which poses a critical challenge for the practical applications of QML. We focus on the combined influence of data encoding, qubit entanglement, and ansatz expressibility in hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNNs) for multi-class classification tasks. Our framework aims to empirically analyze the joint impact of these factors on the training landscape of HQNNs. Our results show that the occurrence of the BP problem in HQNNs is contingent upon the expressibility of the underlying ansatz and the type of the adopted data encoding technique. Additionally, we observe that qubit entanglement also plays a role in exacerbating the BP problem. Leveraging various evaluation metrics for classification tasks, we systematically evaluate the performance of HQNNs and provide recommendations tailored to different constraint scenarios. Our findings emphasize the significance of our framework in addressing the practical success of QNNs. © 2023 The Author(s).

Such algorithms learn the function that maps input to output from the training examples. The algorithms are evaluated with the validation data and then used to predict the output for an unknown dataset. For the past few years, scholars have been researching to improve such classical machine learning algorithms using quantum computing. Some of the latest research is the optimization of computationally expensive algorithms with quantum computing and transforming stochastic procedures into the semantics of quantum theory. The quest for the learning-based algorithm is aspiring: the discipline seeks to comprehend what learning is and studies how algorithms approximate learning. Quantum machine learning takes these aspirations further by looking at the subatomic level to aid learning. Machine learning-based algorithms minimize a constrained multivariate function. Different algorithms have different hyper-parameters that need to be tuned for the trained model to generalize well. Such optimization has high time and space complexity, which is central to learning theory. This contribution gives an organized overview of the evolving arena of quantum machine learning. It presents the methods as well as practical details. We start this chapter by introducing the major components of Quantum Computers, where we provide an overview of quantum computing with an in-depth explanation of the superposition of state, which will be crucial for all quantum algorithms. Next, we exploit a fascinating phenomenon called entanglement in quantum computations. Parallelism is the key to speeding up the training process of learning algorithms. One of the significant advantages of quantum computing is quantum parallelism which we will explore through Grover's search algorithm. Next, we go over the learning mechanism of a traditional machine learning algorithm, namely a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on classical computers. Furthermore, we exploit the Quantum SVM (QSVM) trained on quantum computers. Finally, we solve the famous malignant breast cancer classification problem using the quantum SVM algorithm. We study various simulations in Python language on the mentioned dataset to analyze their time complexity and performances on standard evaluation metrics, namely accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Thanks to its entanglement and super-position qualities, quantum computing, which is based on quantum physics, has a lot of potential for speed and processing capacity. For high power challenges, it is therefore highly common to try to utilize quantum computing units rather than classical computing units. In this study, a hybrid quantum-classical approach was proposed for utilizing quantum computers' advantages in image classification. This hybrid technique uses a variational quantum circuit (VQC) on the quantum computer side. To overcome the qubit restriction in the VQC, multiple amplitude encoding was used as the data encoding method. In the classical computer part of the proposed approach, the preprocessing of the image, the convolution operation, and the optimization of the parameters of the single-qubit rotation gates in the VQC were performed. The proposed approach was trained and tested on two different data sets. The accuracy rates acquired in 2-layers and 4-layers VQCs within the data sets were evaluated in the test results. The proposed approach was evaluated against studies that were similar in the literature.

To explore the structural relationships between quantum theory and natural languages Lambeq toolkit was created. This first high-level open-source Python toolkit for quantum natural language processing offers a fully automated quantum machine learning pipeline. Lambeq currently includes five compositional models that use varying degrees of syntactic information. While the previous studies focus on Discocat model, the aim of this study is to conducte an extensive evaluation of various classifiers based on different compositional models for text classification applications, focusing on the potential advantages of ensemble learning. The classifiers, including Spider, Cups, Stairs, Tree, and DisCoCat, were examined on two datasets: MC and RP. Performance evaluation was carried out using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as the metrics. The results revealed notable variations in the performance of the classifiers across the datasets. Spider emerged as the top-performing classifier on the MC dataset, achieving remarkable scores of 100% in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. However, on the RP dataset, Stairs outperformed the other classifiers with an accuracy of 68%, precision of 71%, recall of 68%, and F1-score of 69%. Furthermore, ensemble models using hard voting and soft voting techniques were constructed and evaluated. The ensemble models showcased improved performance compared to individual classifiers, with the soft voting ensemble achieving a score of 97% for all metrics on the MC dataset, and a precision of 72% and F1-score of 68% on the RP dataset.

Diagnosis is broadly applied in the context of rotating machines' state classification using several traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods. Recently, Quantum Computing (QC), a new and expanding research field, has contributed to different purposes and contexts, such as optimization, artificial intelligence, simulation, cybersecurity, pharmaceutics, and the energy sector. Despite the current limitations in terms of hardware, QC has been studied as an alternative for improving models' speed and computational efficiency. Specifically, this paper proposes a Quantum Machine Learning (QML) approach to diagnose rolling bearings, which are essential components in rotating machinery, based on vibration signals. We apply hybrid models involving the encoding and construction of parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) connected to a classical neural network, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). We consider combinations of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) framework with rotation gates and different entanglement (two-qubits) gates (CNOT, CZ and iSWAP). For each PQC configuration, we assess the impact of the number of layers (1, 5 and 10). We use two databases of different complexity levels not previously explored with QML, namely CWRU and JNU, with 10 and 12 failure modes, respectivel. For CWRU, all QML models presented higher accuracy than the classical MLP. For JNU, all QML models were superior to classical MLP as well. These results suggest that, despite the current limitations of quantum environments, QML models are promising tools to be further investigated in PHM.  © 2013 IEEE.",fault diagnosis; prognostic and health management; Quantum machine learning; vibration signal,Computational efficiency; Deep learning; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Learning systems; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Qubits; Computational modelling; Faults diagnosis; Machine-learning; Prognostic and health management; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Vibration signal; Rotating machinery,Article

Hybrid quantum-classical models have demonstrated exponential speedups in various machine learning tasks compared to their classical counterparts. On one hand, training of QML models on real hardware remains a challenge due to long wait queue and the access cost. On the other hand, simulation-based training is not scalable to large QML models due to exponentially growing simulation time. Since the measurement operation converts quantum information to classical binary data, the quantum circuit is executed multiple times (called shots) to obtain the basis state probabilities or qubit expectation values. Higher number of shots worsen the training time of QML models on real hardware and the access cost. Higher number of shots also increase the simulation-based training time. In this paper, we propose shot optimization method for QML models at the expense of minimal impact on model performance. We use classification task as a test case for MNIST and FMNIST datasets using a hybrid quantum-classical QML model. First, we sweep the number of shots for short and full versions of the dataset. We observe that training the full version provides 5-6% higher testing accuracy than short version of dataset with up to 10X higher number of shots for training. Therefore, one can reduce the dataset size to accelerate the training time. Next, we propose adaptive shot allocation on short version dataset to optimize the number of shots over training epochs and evaluate the impact on classification accuracy. We use a (a) linear function where the number of shots reduce linearly with epochs, and (b) step function where the number of shots reduce in step with epochs. We note around 0.01 increase in loss and maximum ∼4% (1%) reduction in testing accuracy for reduction in shots by up to 100X (10X) for linear (step) shot function compared to conventional constant shot function for MNIST dataset, and 0.05 increase in loss and ∼5-7% (5-7%) reduction in testing accuracy with similar reduction in shots using linear (step) shot function on FMNIST dataset. For comparison, we also use the proposed shot optimization methods to perform ground state energy estimation of different molecules and observe that step function gives the best and most stable ground state energy prediction at 1000X less number of shots. © 2013 IEEE.",classification; Quantum machine learning; shot optimization,Ground state; Machine learning; Quantum optics; Qubits; Statistical tests; % reductions; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Number of shots; Optimisations; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Shot optimization; Testing accuracy; Training time; Classification (of information),Article

However, due to the increasing demand for data processing and fast computing, the idea of enhancing machine learning with quantum computing has been proposed, known as quantum machine learning (QML). Quantum machine learning has the advantages of higher efficiency and accuracy. Quantum computing uses quantum bits (qubits) for data storage and computing, where a qubit can represent quantum states |0and |1simultaneously, enabling the processing of information for two states simultaneously, which is unparalleled in classical computing. Moreover, quantum machine learning can handle more complex data and process data faster. In classical machine learning, the processing of large-scale data and complex problems often faces problems of high computational complexity and low algorithm efficiency. Quantum computing can handle multiple computing tasks simultaneously, achieving faster computing. Therefore, in some scenarios that require efficient computing, quantum machine learning may be the best choice. In this study, we simulated quantum circuits using Qiskit and built a hybrid quantum-classical neural network model using VQNet to classify MNIST handwritten digits and CIFAR-10 datasets. The experiments showed that quantum machine learning has the advantages of efficiency, accuracy, and security over classical machine learning, which may be an improvement over classical machine learning. This research proposes a machine learning algorithm based on quantum computing, which promotes the development of quantum computing and quantum technology. At the same time, it provides a new solution and idea for image classification, enabling people to pursue faster and more accurate quantum machine learning instead of being limited to classical machine learning. © 2023 IEEE.",Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Networks; Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks; Quantum Machine Learning,Classification (of information); Computational complexity; Computational efficiency; Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Digital storage; Image classification; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Quantum efficiency; Quantum optics; Qubits; Classical neural networks; Convolutional neural network; Hybrid quantum-classical neural network; Images classification; Machine-learning; Quantum Computing; Quantum convolutional neural network; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum-classical; Complex networks,Conference paper

Many attempts have been made to develop complete solutions for QA as well as improving significant sub-modules of the QA systems to improve the overall performance through the course of time. Questions are the most important piece of QA, because knowing the question is equivalent to knowing what counts as an answer (Harrah in Philos Sci 28:40–46, 1961, [1]). In this work, we have attempted to understand questions in a better way by using Quantum Machine Learning (QML). The properties of Quantum Computing (QC) have enabled classically intractable data processing. So, in this paper, we have performed question classification on questions from two classes of SelQA (Selection-based Question Answering) dataset using quantum-based classifier algorithms—quantum support vector machine (QSVM) and variational quantum classifier (VQC) from Qiskit (Quantum Information Science toolKIT) for Python. We perform classification with both classifiers in almost similar environments and study the effects of circuit depths while comparing the results of both classifiers. We also use these classification results with our own rule-based QA system and observe significant performance improvement.

We utilize these different methods using the linear time quantum data encoding technique (log 2N) for embedding classical data into quantum states and estimating the inner product on the 15-qubit IBMQ Melbourne quantum computer. We match the predictive performance of our QML approaches with prior QML methods and with their classical counterpart algorithms for three open-access clinical datasets. Our results imply that the qDS in small sample and feature count datasets outperforms kernel-based methods. In contrast, quantum kernel approaches outperform qDS in high sample and feature count datasets.

First, a model of QC-IQS is presented by creating parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) based on the decomposing of unitary operators with the Hamiltonian in the isolated quantum system. Then, a parameterized quantum classification algorithm (QCA) is designed to calculate the classification results by updating the loss function until it converges. Finally, the experiments on nonlinear random number datasets and Iris datasets are designed to demonstrate that the QC-IQS model can handle and generate accurate classification results on different kinds of datasets. The experimental results reveal that the QC-IQS is adaptive and learnable to handle different types of data. Moreover, QC-IQS compensates the issue that the accuracy of previous quantum classifiers declines when dealing with diverse datasets.

The vehicle type classification (VTC) is a crucial ITS task due to its capability to gather valuable traffic information. However, designing a performant VTC method is challenging due to the considerable intra-class variation of vehicles. This paper presents a new quantum decision-based method for VTC applied to video streaming. This method allows for earlier decision-making by considering a few stream’s images. Our method is threefold. First, the video stream is acquired and preprocessed following a specific pipeline. Second, we aim to detect and track vehicles. Therefore, we apply a deep learning-based model to detect vehicles, and then a vehicle tracking algorithm is used to track each detected vehicle. Third, we seek to classify the tracked vehicle according to six defined classes. Furthermore, we transform the tracked vehicles according to a pipeline, consisting of the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and principal component analysis (PCA) methods. Then, we estimate the vehicles’ probabilities of belonging to each class by training multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier with the resulting features. To assign a class to a vehicle, we apply a quantum-inspired probability integrator that handles each frame’s information flow.

Recently, there have been various works on classification problems using quantum neural network (QNN). Different data encoders have been investigated, but efficient quantum encoding schemes for high-dimensional data such as images are still an open question. In this study, we investigate popular representation formats of quantum images, namely FRQI and NEQR, as data encoders for quantum neural networks. It is found that the FRQI format not only provides the best classification accuracy compared to NEQR and other popular encoding methods but also is consistent across different circuit depths of QNN. It should be noted that FRQI is notorious for its probabilistic representation in quantum image processing. The finding of this study is interesting because FRQI can play an important role in the field of quantum machine learning.  © 2022 IEEE.",Hybrid quantum-classical architecture; NISQ applications; Quantum Image Representations; Quantum Machine Learning,Clustering algorithms; Encoding (symbols); Image coding; Machine learning; Signal encoding; Hybrid quantum-classical architecture; Image representations; Machine-learning; NISQ application; Quantum image representation; Quantum images; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum neural networks; Quantum-classical; Image representation,Conference paper

However, there are still a few standpoints in terms of diagnosis and planning that can be transformed via quantum Machine Learning (QML). In this study, we present a hybrid classical–quantum machine learning model for the detection of Alzheimer’s using 6400 labeled MRI scans with two classes. Hybrid classical–quantum transfer learning is used, which makes it possible to optimally pre-process complex and high-dimensional data. Classical neural networks extract high-dimensional features and embed informative feature vectors into a quantum processor. We use resnet34 to extract features from the image and feed a 512-feature vector to our quantum variational circuit (QVC) to generate a four-feature vector for precise decision boundaries. Adam optimizer is used to exploit the adaptive learning rate corresponding to each parameter based on first-and second-order gradients. Furthermore, to validate the model, different quantum simulators (PennyLane, qiskit.aer and qiskit.basicaer) are used for the detection of the demented and non-demented images. The learning rate is set to 10−4 for and optimized quantum depth of six layers, resulting in a training accuracy of 99.1% and a classification accuracy of 97.2% for 20 epochs. The hybrid classical–quantum network significantly outperformed the classical network, as the classification accuracy achieved by the classical transfer learning model was 92%. Thus, a hybrid transfer-learning model is used for binary detection, in which a quantum circuit improves the performance of a pre-trained ResNet34 architecture. Therefore, this work offers a method for selecting an optimal approach for detecting Alzheimer’s disease. The proposed model not only allows for the automated detection of Alzheimer’s but would also speed up the process significantly in clinical settings. © 2022 by the authors.

However, the processing and analysis of industrial Internet big data brings us opportunities at the same time, but also unprecedented privacy concerns. Privacy security is an important part of industrial Internet security. Research on big data analysis algorithms of industrial Internet with privacy protection has been very urgent and severe. Industrial Internet big data processing also has higher requirements for privacy, efficiency and accuracy. We propose a quantum K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm with privacy-protecting characteristics, and find an encryption method for the original training sample set and the sample to be tested, so that the ciphertext sample input to the quantum cloud server can get the same prediction result as the original sample input. In this algorithm, because of the inversion of a prediction result corresponding to N+1 input data, it is difficult to deduce the model, parameters, input data and related attribute characteristics from the prediction results obtained by multiple visits to the quantum cloud server. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can well resist model extraction attack, model reverse attack, member inference attack, attribute inference attack and so on. Compared with the existing quantum machine learning algorithm with privacy protection, it is found that the privacy protection scheme in this paper is superior to the existing schemes in three aspects of privacy, complexity and availability, which achieves privacy protection without increasing additional computing overhead, reducing the efficiency and availability of the algorithm, and affecting the accuracy of the algorithm. We provide a new method to protect the privacy of quantum machine learning and a new idea to improve the comprehensive performance of industrial Internet big data analysis in terms of privacy, efficiency and accuracy, which has important theoretical value and practical significance. © 2022, Science Press.

Data is becoming voluminous rapidly, so it is challenging for classical computers to train Machine Learning (ML) models over massive datasets. The hope is that quantum physics' intrinsic features, such as entanglement, superposition, and interference, could be exploited as resources for training ML models on big datasets that would otherwise be relatively impossible for classical computers. It is theoretically proven that quantum computers have an exponential-time advantage over their classical counterparts in solving several problems, e.g., complex large dimensional matrix multiplication, factorization problem, unstructured database search, etc. QML models attempt to find a quantum advantage over their classical counterparts. Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC) are hybrid quantum neural networks to perform the task of classification using QML models. VQC models in the present NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum - 50 to 100 qubits) era can produce comparable and even better results than Classical models. In this article, we examined the performance of a VQC while performing a simple binary classification task. In this article, we use a VQC to evaluate this method's performance empirically. We constructed a VQC to predict the label of fresh input for the typical Iris dataset comprising pairings of target outputs and training inputs. Our quantum classifier can reasonably predict species labels using only four qubits. These levels are fairly good compared to the accuracy levels attained by classical classifiers.  © 2022 IEEE.",Quantum Computing; Quantum Machine Learning; Variational Quantum Classifiers,Classification (of information); Large dataset; Learning systems; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Qubits; Search engines; Classical counterpart; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Performance; Performances evaluation; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Research areas; Variational quantum classifier; Machine learning,Conference paper

However, normally, it can only handle low-dimensional data. This study presented a variational quantum deep neural network (VQDNN) model for various scale image recognition tasks. Three classifiers were designed to verify the classification performance of the proposed VQDNN model. In the first classifier, to accommodate the limitations of qubits in both simulation hardware and real quantum hardware – we adopted hybrid principal component analysis – VQDNN architecture. Moreover, the amplitude encoding scheme and the rotation angle coding scheme were employed in the subsequent two classifiers to handle large-size images. Finally, we used the classical neural network and VQDNN model to conduct a comparative experiment of the ten-label classification learning task on the same dataset. The quantum numerical experiment was implemented on two benchmark datasets: the MNIST and UCI databases of handwritten digits. The simulation results showed that the proposed VQDNN classified the two datasets with an accuracy of 100% for the two-class classification task, while the UCI dataset has an accuracy of 90.87% for the ten-label classification task. The proposed VQDNN achieved better classification accuracy than the original classical neural network even under a limited number of qubits available in current hardware, indicating the promising application potential of VQDNN in image recognition. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Parametrized quantum circuit; Quantum computation; Quantum deep neural network; Quantum machine learning; Variational quantum algorithms,Classification (of information); Image classification; Image coding; Image recognition; Neural network models; Principal component analysis; Quantum computers; Timing circuits; Learning tasks; Machine-learning; Neural network model; Parametrized quantum circuit; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Quantum deep neural network; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Variational quantum algorithm; Article; controlled study; deep neural network; machine learning; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; principal component analysis; quantum yield; Deep neural networks,Article

It is well known that the success of a given tensor network ansatz depends in part on how well it can reproduce the underlying entanglement structure of the target state, with different network designs favoring different scaling patterns. We demonstrate here how a related correlation analysis can be applied to tensor network machine learning, and explore whether classical data possess correlation scaling patterns similar to those found in quantum states, which might indicate the best network to use for a given dataset. We utilize mutual information (MI) as measure of correlations in classical data, and show that it can serve as a lower-bound on the entanglement needed for a probabilistic tensor network classifier. We then develop a logistic regression algorithm to estimate the MI between bipartitions of data features, and verify its accuracy on a set of Gaussian distributions designed to mimic different correlation patterns. Using this algorithm, we characterize the scaling patterns in the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology and Tiny Images datasets, and find clear evidence of boundary-law scaling in the latter.

In recent years, two class classification of good and defective products must be carried out efficiently as the number of small-quantity, high-mix products have been increasing. The support vector machine with kernel method (kernel learning) is the most popular method in two class classification used in factories. Quantum kernel learning is one of the most promising applications of quantum technology. In this study, we propose an analysis method that allows us to know the difference between classical and quantum machine learning by plotting false positive rate (FPR) and true positive rate (TPR) on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) space. Quantum machine learning uses quantum data with feature maps. We compared quantum and classical data using a small-sized existing datasets. First, it was not possible to confirm that the quantum data incorporating quantum entanglement could achieve the effect in this study. Next, when we examined the learning process of quantum data with Pauli feature map and classical data, we observed differences in the initial learning process. Based on these results, in contrast to the commonly used ROC curve, we plotted the FPR and TPR separately on the ROC space according to the training size. Plotting on ROC space in this experiment shows that quantum kernel learning is a method to reduce only FPR from high FPR and TPR. We found that the kernel learning process using quantum data is different from one using classical data.  © 2022 IEEE.",Quantum kernel; quantum machine learning; ROC; Support Vector Machine,Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Support vector machines; False positive rates; Kernel learning; Learning process; Machine-learning; Quantum data; Quantum kernel; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Receiver operating characteristics; Support vectors machine; Quantum entanglement,Conference paper

However, the scale and utility of neural networks is still greatly limited by the current hardware used to train them. These concerns have become increasingly pressing as conventional computers are soon expected to approach the physical limitations that will slow their performance improvements in the near future. For these reasons, scientists have begun to explore alternative computing platforms, like quantum computers, for training neural networks. In recent years, variational quantum circuits have emerged as one of the most successful approaches to quantum deep learning on noisy intermediate scale quantum devices. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical neural network architecture where each neuron is a variational quantum circuit. We empirically analyze the performance of this hybrid neural network on a series of binary classification data sets using a simulated IBM universal quantum computer and a state-of-the-art IBM universal quantum computer. On the simulated hardware, we observe that the hybrid neural network achieves around 10% higher classification accuracy and 20% better minimization of the cost function than an individual variational quantum circuit. On the quantum hardware, we observe that each model only performs well when the qubit and gate count is sufficiently small.  © 2022 IEEE.",Deep Learning; Deep Neural Networks; Hybrid Algorithms; Hybrid Neural Networks; Quantum Artificial Intelligence; Quantum Deep Learning; Quantum Machine Learning; Quantum Neural Networks; Variational Quantum Circuits,Classification (of information); Computer hardware; Cost functions; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Network architecture; Quantum computers; Deep learning; Hybrid algorithms; Hybrid neural networks; Machine-learning; Quantum artificial intelligence; Quantum circuit; Quantum deep learning; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum neural networks; Variational quantum circuit; Timing circuits,Conference paper

Recently, Lloyd et al. have advanced the proposal to embed classical data into quantum ones: these live in the more complex Hilbert space where they can get split into linearly separable clusters. Here, these ideas are implemented by engineering two different experimental platforms, based on quantum optics and ultra-cold atoms, respectively, where we adapt and numerically optimize the quantum embedding protocol by deep learning methods, and test it for some trial classical data. A similar analysis is also performed on the Rigetti superconducting quantum computer. Therefore, it is found that the quantum embedding approach successfully works also at the experimental level and, in particular, we show how different platforms could work in a complementary fashion to achieve this task.

This work studies applications of variational quantum circuits and machine-learning techniques for discriminating such channels. In particular, we explore (i) the practical implementation of embedding this task into the framework of variational quantum computing, (ii) training a quantum classifier based on variational quantum circuits, and (iii) applying the quantum kernel estimation technique. For testing these three channel discrimination approaches, we considered a pair of entanglement-breaking channels and the depolarizing channel with two different depolarization factors. For the approach (i), we address solving the quantum channel discrimination problem using widely discussed parallel and sequential strategies. We show the advantage of the latter in terms of better convergence with less quantum resources. Quantum channel discrimination with a variational quantum classifier (ii) allows one to operate even with random and mixed input states and simple variational circuits. The kernel-based classification approach (iii) is also found effective as it allows one to discriminate depolarizing channels associated not with just fixed values of the depolarization factor, but with ranges of it. Additionally, we discovered that a simple modification of one of the commonly used kernels significantly increases the efficiency of this approach. Finally, our numerical findings reveal that the performance of variational methods of channel discrimination depends on the trace of the product of the output states. These findings demonstrate that quantum machine learning can be used to discriminate channels, such as those representing physical noise processes.  © 2022 American Physical Society.

Recently, it has been shown that models with little to no inductive biases (i.e., with no assumptions about the problem embedded in the model) are likely to have trainability and generalization issues, especially for large problem sizes. As such, it is fundamental to develop schemes that encode as much information as available about the problem at hand. In this work we present a simple, yet powerful, framework where the underlying invariances in the data are used to build QML models that, by construction, respect those symmetries. These so-called group-invariant models produce outputs that remain invariant under the action of any element of the symmetry group G associated with the dataset. We present theoretical results underpinning the design of G-invariant models, and exemplify their application through several paradigmatic QML classification tasks, including cases when G is a continuous Lie group and also when it is a discrete symmetry group. Notably, our framework allows us to recover, in an elegant way, several well-known algorithms for the literature, as well as to discover new ones. Taken together, we expect that our results will help pave the way towards a more geometric and group-theoretic approach to QML model design.  © 2022 authors.

There have been many proposals on how to use variational quantum circuits as quantum perceptrons or as QNNs. The aim of this work is to introduce a teacher-student scheme that could systematically compare any QNN architectures and evaluate their relative expressive power. Specifically, the teacher model generates the datasets mapping random inputs to outputs which then have to be learned by the student models. This way, we avoid training on arbitrary data sets and allow to compare the learning capacity of different models directly via the loss, the prediction map, the accuracy and the relative entropy between the prediction maps. Here, we focus particularly on a quantum perceptron model inspired by the recent work of Tacchino et al. (2019) and compare it to the data re-uploading scheme that was originally introduced by Pérez-Salinas et al. (2020). We discuss alterations of the perceptron model and the formation of deep QNN to better understand the role of hidden units and the non-linearities in these architectures. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Machine learning; Quantum neural networks; Quantum perceptrons; Variational quantum circuits,Network architecture; Students; Timing circuits; Kernel-methods; Machine learning models; Neural networks structure; Perceptron neural networks; Quantum circuit; Quantum device; Quantum neural networks; Quantum perceptron; Teachers'; Variational quantum circuit; Machine learning,Article

Quantum algorithms have significant advantages over classical algorithms in terms of speed and capacity. In this work, a quantum support vector machine algorithm based on gradient descent is proposed. Firstly, in the training stage, quantum gradient descent was used to obtain the training parameters, which reduces the time complexity of a single iteration from the classical polynomial level to the logarithmic level. Then, in the classification stage, we built a quantum classifier that can classify multiple samples at the same time, thereby improving the efficiency of classification.

Ordinal regression (or classification) considers the order of the values of the categorical labels and thus takes into account the order of grading scales used to assess the severity of different medical conditions. This paper presents a quantum-inspired deep probabilistic learning ordinal regression model for medical image diagnosis that takes advantage of the representational power of deep learning and the intrinsic ordinal information of disease stages. The method is evaluated on two different medical image analysis tasks: prostate cancer diagnosis and diabetic retinopathy grade estimation on eye fundus images. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only improves the diagnosis performance on the two tasks but also the interpretability of the results by quantifying the uncertainty of the predictions in comparison to conventional deep classification and regression architectures.

The classification of pixels into their respective classes was experimented using two techniques, One vs One (OVO) and One vs Rest (OVR).

In this work, we find that QNNs have an Achilles’ heel in binary pattern classification. To illustrate this point, we provide a theoretical insight into the properties of QNNs by presenting and analyzing a new form of symmetry embedded in a family of QNNs with full entanglement, which we term negational symmetry. Due to negational symmetry, QNNs can not differentiate between a quantum binary signal and its negational counterpart. We empirically evaluate the negational symmetry of QNNs in binary pattern classification tasks using Google's quantum computing framework. Both theoretical and experimental results suggest that negational symmetry is a fundamental property of QNNs, which is not shared by classical models. Our findings also imply that negational symmetry is a double-edged sword in practical quantum applications. © 2022 The Author(s)",Binary pattern classification; Deep learning; Quantum machine learning; Representation learning; Symmetry,Quantum computers; Achilles' heel; Binary pattern classification; Binary patterns; Deep learning; Patterns classification; Quantum machine learning; Quantum neural networks; Representation learning; Simple++; Symmetry; Deep learning,Article

The detection of relevant features that describe the expressions of different individuals is vital to describe human expressions accurately. The present work has employed the integrated concept of Local Binary Pattern and Histogram of Gradient for facial feature extraction. The major contribution of the paper is the optimization of the extracted features using quantum-inspired meta-heuristic algorithms of QGA (Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithm), QGSA (Quantum-Inspired Gravitational Search Algorithm), QPSO (Quantum-Inspired Particle Swarm Optimization), and QFA (Quantum-Inspired Firefly Algorithm).

The facial expressions are detected for the KDEF and RaFD datasets under varying yaw angles of -90, -45, 0, 45, and 90. The detection of facial expressions with varying angles is also a crucial contribution, as the features decrease with the increasing yaw angle movement of the face.

The existing methodologies pertain to cancer classification are mostly clinical basis, and its diagnosis capability is limited. Nowadays, the significant problems of cancer diagnosis are solved by the utilization of gene expression data. The researchers have been introducing many possibilities to diagnose cancer appropriately and effectively. This paper aims to develop the cancer data classification using gene expression data. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed classification model involves three main phases: “(1) Feature extraction, (2) Optimal Feature Selection and (3) Classification”. Initially, five benchmark gene expression datasets are collected. From the collected gene expression data, the feature extraction is performed. To diminish the length of the feature vectors, optimal feature selection is performed, for which a new meta-heuristic algorithm termed as quantum-inspired immune clone optimization algorithm (QICO) is used. Once the relevant features are selected, the classification is performed by a deep learning model called recurrent neural network (RNN). Finally, the experimental analysis reveals that the proposed QICO-based feature selection model outperforms the other heuristic-based feature selection and optimized RNN outperforms the other machine learning methods. Findings: The proposed QICO-RNN is acquiring the best outcomes at any learning percentage. On considering the learning percentage 85, the accuracy of the proposed QICO-RNN was 3.2% excellent than RNN, 4.3% excellent than RF, 3.8% excellent than NB and 2.1% excellent than KNN for Dataset 1. For Dataset 2, at learning percentage 35, the accuracy of the proposed QICO-RNN was 13.3% exclusive than RNN, 8.9% exclusive than RF and 14.8% exclusive than NB and KNN.

In this domain, one of the more investigated approaches is the use of a special type of quantum circuit – a so-called quantum neural network – to serve as a basis for a machine learning model. Roughly speaking, as the name suggests, a quantum neural network can play a similar role to a neural network. However, specifically for applications in machine learning contexts, very little is known about suitable circuit architectures, or model hyperparameters one should use to achieve good learning performance. In this work, we apply the functional ANOVA framework to quantum neural networks to analyze which of the hyperparameters were most influential for their predictive performance. We analyze one of the most typically used quantum neural network architectures. We then apply this to 7 open-source datasets from the OpenML-CC18 classification benchmark whose number of features is small enough to fit on quantum hardware with less than 20 qubits. Three main levels of importance were detected from the ranking of hyperparameters obtained with functional ANOVA. Our experiment both confirmed expected patterns and revealed new insights. For instance, setting well the learning rate is deemed the most critical hyperparameter in terms of marginal contribution on all datasets, whereas the particular choice of entangling gates used is considered the least important except on one dataset. This work introduces new methodologies to study quantum machine learning models and provides new insights toward quantum model selection. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Hyperparameter importance; Quantum machine learning; Quantum neural networks,Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Classification (of information); Network architecture; Qubits; Functional ANOVA; Hyper-parameter; Hyperparameter importance; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Quanta computers; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum neural networks; Small data set; Machine learning,Conference paper

A large body of existing works focus on using variational quantum algorithms on the gate level for machine learning tasks, such as the variational quantum circuit (VQC). However, VQC has limited flexibility and expressibility due to limited number of parameters, e.g. only one parameter can be trained in one rotation gate. On the other hand, we observe that quantum pulses are lower than quantum gates in the stack of quantum computing and offers more control parameters. Inspired by the promising performance of VQC, in this paper we propose variational quantum pulses (VQP), a novel paradigm to directly train quantum pulses for learning tasks. The proposed method manipulates variational quantum pulses by pulling and pushing the amplitudes of pulses in an optimization framework. Similar to variational quantum algorithms, our framework to train pulses maintains the robustness to noise on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. In an example task of binary classification, VQP learning achieves up to 11% and 9% higher accuracy compared with VQC learning on the qiskit pulse simulators (with system model from real machine) and ibmq-jarkata, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness and feasibility. Stability for VQP to obtain reliable results has also been verified in the presence of noise.  © 2022 IEEE.",Quantum Computing; Quantum Machine Learning; Quantum Optimal Control; Variational Quantum Circuit; Variational Quantum Pulse,Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Timing circuits; Learning tasks; Machine-learning; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum optimal controls; Variational quantum circuit; Variational quantum pulse; Machine learning,Conference paper

Many quantum (convolutional) circuit ansaetze are proposed for grayscale images classification tasks with promising empirical results. However, when applying these ansaetze on RGB images, the intra-channel information that is useful for vision tasks is not extracted effectively. In this paper, we propose two types of quantum circuit ansaetze to simulate convolution operations on RGB images, which differ in the way how inter-channel and intra-channel information is extracted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of a quantum convolutional circuit to deal with RGB images effectively, with a higher test accuracy compared to the purely classical CNNs. We also investigate the relationship between the size of quantum circuit ansatz and the learnability of the hybrid quantum–classical convolutional neural network. Through experiments based on CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets, we demonstrate that a larger size of the quantum circuit ansatz improves predictive performance in multiclass classification tasks, providing useful insights for near term quantum algorithm developments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",QCNN; Quantum computing; Quantum machine learning,Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Image classification; Machine learning; Qubits; Channel information; Classification tasks; Coherence time; Images classification; QCNN; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Rapid growth; RGB images; Convolution,Article

However, identifying edible insects can be difficult due to their small size and the similar morphological features in closely related species. Therefore, classification of insects is often conducted by amplifying their DNA barcode sequence and comparing it with databases containing reference sequences. However, the absence of reference DNA sequences (such as cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI)) may confound predictions of the taxonomic community of interest and make it difficult to characterize biodiversity from DNA samples. Objective: To develop a quantum-inspired tensor network-based machine-learning model to categorize COI sequences for four insects belonging to the Orthoptera order. Materials & Methods: For alignment-free classification, each DNA barcode was represented as a tensor product of k-mers encoded in a D-dimensional space, which acts as the feature map and input for a tensor network layer for the classification. The developed model was tested with two different numbers of tensor units as well as different k-mer sizes. Results: The presented model was effective for making accurate predictions for unseen DNA barcodes and can be generalized for any DNA/RNA sequence categorization. The tensor network classifier could assign COI sequences of varying lengths to four different classes with an accuracy greater than 99% and with fewer hyper-parameters.

Increasing the degree of autonomy and improving cognitive performance, which can be assessed using cognitive and behavioral tests, are two important research trends. The degree of autonomy can be increased using higher-level psychological modules with which needs and motives are taken into account. In our approach we integrate these modules in architecture for an embodied, enactive multi-agent system, such that distributed problem solutions can be achieved. Furthermore, after uncovering some weaknesses in the cognitive performance of traditionally designed agents, we focus on two major aspects. On the one hand, the knowledge processing of cognitive agents is based on logical formalisms, which have deficiencies in the representation and processing of incomplete or uncertain knowledge. On the other hand, in order to fully understand the performance of cognitive agents, explanations at the symbolic and subsymbolic levels are required. Both aspects can be addressed by quantum-inspired cognitive agents. To investigate this approach, we consider two tasks in the sphere of Shannon's famous mouse-maze problem: namely classifying target objects and ontology inference. First, the classification of an unknown target object in the mouse-maze, such as cheese, water, and bacon, is based on sensory data that measure characteristics such as odor, color, shape, or nature. For an intelligent agent, we need a classifier with good prediction accuracy and explanatory power on a symbolic level. Boolean logic classifiers do work on a symbolic level but are not adequate for dealing with continuous data. Therefore, we demonstrate and evaluate a quantum-logic-inspired classifier in comparison to Boolean-logic-based classifiers. Second, ontology inference is iteratively achieved by a quantum-inspired agent through maze exploration. This requires the agent to be able to manipulate its own state by performing actions and by collecting sensory data during perception. We suggest an algebraic approach where both kinds of behaviors are uniquely described by quantum operators. The agent's state space is then iteratively constructed by carrying out unitary action operators, while Hermitian perception operators act as observables on quantum eigenstates. As a result, an ontology emerges as the simultaneous solution of the respective eigenvalue equations.

Quantum SVM variational and kernel matrix algorithms are implemented to analyze quantum speedup on quantum simulator and physical quantum processor back-ends. The study compared classical and quantum SVM algorithms in terms of execution time and accuracy. The results explicitly prove quantum speed-up achieved by quantum classifiers on quantum back-ends for machine learning applications. © 2022 National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

Considering its significance in business intelligence and decision-making, numerous efforts have been made in this area. However, lack of dictionaries, unannotated data, large-scale unstructured data, and low accuracies have plagued these approaches. Also, sentiment classification through classifier ensemble has been underexplored in literature. In this article, we propose a Semantic Relational Machine Learning (SRML) model that automatically classifies the sentiment of tweets by using classifier ensemble and optimal features. The model employs the Cascaded Feature Selection (CFS) strategy, a novel statistical assessment approach based on Wilcoxon rank sum test, univariate logistic regression assisted significant predictor test and cross-correlation test. It further uses the efficacy of word2vec-based continuous bagofwords and n-gram feature extraction in conjunction with SentiWordNet for finding optimal features for classification. We experiment on six public Twitter sentiment datasets, the STS-Gold dataset, the Obama-McCain Debate (OMD) dataset, the healthcare reform (HCR) dataset and the SemEval2017 Task 4A, 4B and 4C on a heterogeneous classifier ensemble comprising fourteen individual classifiers from different paradigms. Results from the experimental study indicate that CFS supports in attaining a higher classification accuracy with up to 50% lesser features compared to count vectorizer approach. In Intra-model performance assessment, the Artificial Neural Network-Gradient Descent (ANN-GD) classifier performs comparatively better than other individual classifiers, but the Best Trained Ensemble (BTE) strategy outperforms on all metrics. In inter-model performance assessment with existing state-of-the-art systems, the proposed model achieved higher accuracy and outperforms more accomplished models employing quantum-inspired sentiment representation (QSR), transformer-based methods like BERT, BERTweet, RoBERTa and ensemble techniques. The research thus provides critical insights into implementing similar strategy into building more generic and robust expert system for sentiment analysis that can be leveraged across industries. © Copyright 2022 Yenkikar et al.",Deep learning; Ensemble model; Natural language processing; Sentiment analysis,Classification (of information); Decision making; Deep learning; Expert systems; Feature Selection; Gradient methods; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Quantum theory; Semantics; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Classifiers ensemble; Deep learning; Ensemble models; Features selection; Heterogeneous classifiers; Language processing; Machine learning models; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Sentiment analysis; Optimization,Article

Its interplay with quantum physics may lead to unprecedented perspectives for both fundamental research and commercial applications, giving rise to an emergent research frontier of quantum machine learning. Along this line, quantum classifiers, which are quantum devices that aim to solve classification problems in machine learning, have attracted tremendous attention recently. In this review, we give a relatively comprehensive overview for the studies of quantum classifiers, with a focus on recent advances. First, we will review a number of quantum classification algorithms, including quantum support vector machines, quantum kernel methods, quantum decision tree classifiers, quantum nearest neighbor algorithms, and quantum annealing based classifiers. Then, we move on to introduce the variational quantum classifiers, which are essentially variational quantum circuits for classifications. We will review different architectures for constructing variational quantum classifiers and introduce the barren plateau problem, where the training of quantum classifiers might be hindered by the exponentially vanishing gradient. In addition, the vulnerability aspect of quantum classifiers in the setting of adversarial learning and the recent experimental progress on different quantum classifiers will also be discussed. © 2021, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",quantum classifiers; quantum kernel methods; quantum machine learning; variational quantum algorithms,Decision trees; Support vector machines; Broad spectrum; Fundamental research; Kernel-methods; Quantum algorithms; Quantum classifier; Quantum kernel method; Quantum machine learning; Quantum physics; Research applications; Variational quantum algorithm; Quantum theory,Review

The vector representations of current models are generally constrained to real values. Based on mathematical formulations of quantum theory, quantum language models have drawn increasing attention. Words in such models can be projected as physical particles in quantum systems, and naturally represented by representation-rich complex-valued vectors in a Hilbert Space, rather than real-valued ones. In this paper, the Hilbert Space representation for ABSA models is investigated and the complexification of three strong real-valued baselines are constructed. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of complexification and the outperformance of our complex-valued models, illustrating that the complex-valued embedding can carry additional information beyond the real embedding.

We demonstrate that partitioning training sets into different chemical classes prior to training results in independently trained QML models with overall reduced training data needs. For organic molecules drawn from previously published QM7 and QM9-data-sets we have identified and exploited three relevant classes corresponding to compounds containing either aromatic rings and carbonyl groups, or single unsaturated bonds, or saturated bonds The selected QML models of band-gaps (considered at GW and hybrid DFT levels of theory) reach mean absolute prediction errors of ∼0.1 eV for up to an order of magnitude fewer training molecules than for QML models trained on randomly selected molecules. Comparison to Δ-QML models of band-gaps indicates that selected QML exhibit superior data-efficiency.

It is a metabolic disorder and triggers many other chronic diseases such as heart attack, diabetic nephropathy, brain strokes, etc. The prime objective of this work is to develop a prognosis tool based on the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset that will help medical practitioners in reducing the lethality associated with diabetes. Methods: Based on the features present in the dataset, two prediction models have been proposed by employing deep learning (DL) and quantum machine learning (QML) techniques.

The outlier rejection, filling missing values, and normalization have been used to uplift the discriminatory performance of these models. Also, the performance of these models has been compared against state-of-the-art models. Results: The performance measures such as precision, accuracy, recall, F1 score, specificity, balanced accuracy, false detection rate, missed detection rate, and diagnostic odds ratio have been achieved as 0.90, 0.95, 0.95, 0.93, 0.95, 0.95, 0.03, 0.02, and 399.00 for DL model respectively, However for QML, these measures have been computed as 0.74, 0.86, 0.85, 0.79, 0.86, 0.86, 0.11, 0.05, and 35.89 respectively. Conclusion: The proposed DL model has a high diabetes prediction accuracy as compared with the developed QML and existing state-of-the-art models.

The most common pediatric brain cancers are posterior fossa tumors, with Medulloblastoma (MB) and Ependymoma (EP) being the most common. Although the treatment and prognosis of MB and EP are different, visual characteristics of these tumors are often overlapping, sometimes making the diagnostic process difficult. Therefore, the aim of the current study is twofold: (i) to conduct a comparative analysis with support vector machine (SVM) algorithm and quantum-enhanced support vector machine (QSVM) using multiparametric (mp) MRI of tissue characteristics of whole lesion outlining its diffusivity, cellularity, and vascularity in differentiating MB from EP; and (ii) to explore the effect of noise data on the QSVM. The screening MR examinations of 49 children; MB (n=40) and EP (n=9) were included in the analysis. We used semi quantitative MR imaging features, which give information about the vascularity characteristics of lesion. We utilized precomputed quantum kernel and fed it into classical SVM to classify these tumors. The data gets mapped to high dimensional Hilbert space with PauliFeatureMap. In addition, we further compared the classification performance of QSVM with classical SVM. In the next part of the study, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) method was used for balancing the imbalanced data points of MB and EP. Here, we investigated the performance of QSVM on noisy data. QSVM gave the superior performance with 90% test score value. Classical SVM compared to QSVM, gave the equal performance with 90% for linear, polynomial, radial basis function and sigmoid kernels and lower performance with 80% for poly kernel. In the case of noisy data, the performance of QSVM fell to 50%. Our study confirms that the QSVM method could be used for posterior fossa brain tumor classification problems with higher performance.  © 2022 IEEE.",Ependymoma; Medulloblastoma; Quantum-enhanced support vector machine; SMOTE; Support vector machine,Balancing; Brain; Diagnosis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Radial basis function networks; Tumors; Vectors; Brain tumors; Causes of death; Ependymoma; Medulloblastoma; Noisy data; Performance; Quantum-enhanced support vector machine; Support vectors machine; Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques; Support vector machines,Conference paper

This training speedup is achieved by processing multiple samples, from a classical data set, in parallel during the training process. The proposed algorithm utilizes a quantum RAM along with other quantum circuits for implementing the forward pass. Besides, instead of computing the loss classically, which is the usual practice, we calculate the loss here using a swap test circuit. As a result, our algorithm reduces the training cost of a variational classifier trained for m epochs from the usual O(mN) (which is also the case with most classical machine learning algorithms) to O(N+ mlog N) where the data set contains N samples. Ignoring the one-time overhead of loading the N training samples into the qRAM, the time complexity per epoch of training is O(log N) in our proposed algorithm, as opposed to O(N) (which is the case for other variational algorithms and most classical machine learning algorithms). By performing quantum-circuit simulations on the Pennylane package, we show fairly accurate training using our proposed algorithm on a popular, classical data set: Fisher’s Iris data set of flowers. While we restrict ourselves to binary classification (of samples from classical data sets) in this paper, our algorithm can be easily generalized to carry out multi-class classification. Our proposed algorithm (Fast-QTrain) can also be adapted for any classification ansatz used in the variational circuit as long as the encoding of the classical data into qubits is non-parameterized. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Quantum machine learning; Supervised learning; Variational algorithm,Circuit simulation; Classification (of information); Machine learning; Data set; Machine learning algorithms; Multiple samples; Novel algorithm; Quantum circuit; Quantum machine learning; Test circuit; Training costs; Training process; Variational algorithms; Learning algorithms,Article

However, there are indications that certain quantum machine learning algorithms might result in improved training capabilities with respect to their classical counterparts - which might be particularly beneficial in situations with little training data available. Such situations naturally arise in medical classification tasks. Within this paper, different hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural networks (QCCNN) with varying quantum circuit designs and encoding techniques are proposed. They are applied to two- and three-dimensional medical imaging data, e.g. featuring different, potentially malign, lesions in computed tomography scans. The performance of these QCCNNs is already similar to the one of their classical counterparts therefore encouraging further studies towards the direction of applying these algorithms within medical imaging tasks.  © 2022 IEEE.",convolutional neural networks; CT scans; imaging; medical classification; quantum computing; quantum machine learning,Computerized tomography; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Image classification; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Qubits; Classical counterpart; Convolutional neural network; CT-scan; Machine-learning; Medical classification; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum-classical; Radiological images; Medical imaging,Conference paper

According to the recent statistical survey reports, the increasing mortality rate is due to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, the use of tobacco, obesity, and an inconsistent pulse rate. It is difficult and time-consuming to investigate the various variations of these factors and their impact on Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Therefore, it is necessary to use modern approaches to diagnose the disease early and minimize the mortality rate. The fields of machine learning and data mining have a wide research dimension and various novel techniques that could help in the prediction of CAD in its early stages and identify their patterns and behaviors in a huge amount of data. The results of such predictions will aid the clinical staff in decision making and early diagnosis. In such a scenario, we proposed a quantum version of the Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCQ-CNN) for Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) classification. The proposed model evaluates the quantum circuit-based technique that was inspired by convolutional neural networks, a very successful machine learning model. This method provides O(log (n)) depth for n qubits, reducing the number of parameters and allowing for effective training and testing of real quantum devices. The model has been evaluated by considering the IHD dataset after the data has been cleaned and filtered through the Maximally Relevant Minimally Redundancy (MRMR) filter. For dimension reduction, a Support Vector Machine along with Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) has been considered. Initially, the model is tested with 20% of the whole dataset and gets the promising results of a testing accuracy of 84.6% with a testing loss of 0.28. By taking into account the same optimal parameters, the proposed model outcomes are compared to those of the classical Optimized Convolution Neural Network (Optimized-CNN) and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) models. Comparing the model's competency to that of earlier published quantum models yields improvements in accuracy of 8.6%, 12.6%, 3.5%, and 1.8% respectively.  © 2013 IEEE.",feature selection; hyperparameters optimization; Ischemic cardiopathy classification; quantum machine learning algorithm,Bioinformatics; Cardiology; Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision making; Diagnosis; Diseases; Feature Selection; Heart; Integrated circuits; Learning algorithms; Neural networks; Quantum optics; Semiconductor quantum dots; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; Timing circuits; Features extraction; Features selection; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Integrated circuit modeling; Ischemic cardiopathy classification; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Predictive models; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning algorithm; Quantum machines; Solid modelling; Convolution,Article

These neural networks can have different levels of quantum- classical hybridization depending on the complexity of the problem. The previous work on CV neural network protocols requires the implementation of non-Gaussian operators in the network. These operators are used to introduce non-linearity which is an essential feature of neural networks. Due to these operators, the protocols become hard to execute experimentally. We built a CV hybrid quantum-classical neural network protocol that can be realized experimentally. Our protocol uses Gaussian gates only with the addition of ancillary qumodes. We achieve non-linearity through measurements on ancillary qumodes. Our gates can be implemented with squeezers and beam splitters; hence our protocol can be realized experimentally. We study two canonical machine learning problems in a supervised learning setting - curve fitting and binary classification to test our neural network. For the curve fitting problem, we used a fully quantum neural network which produced exceptional results as discussed in the paper. The second problem was more complicated in that we found the fraudulent transaction in the credit card data. After training, our model was able to identify genuine data with almost 92% accuracy. After studying both the problem, we can confidently conclude that our protocol gives good results with a great advantage that it can be implemented experimentally with current photonic quantum hardware.  © 2022 IEEE.",Continuous-Variable; Quantum Machine Learning,Learning systems; Network protocols; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Continuous variables; Hybridisation; Machine-learning; Neural network model; Neural-networks; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum neural networks; Quantum-classical; Curve fitting,Conference paper

The primary objective of QML is to enhance the performance of traditional ML algorithms by harnessing quantum phenomena. Inspired by the success of classical neural networks (NNs), their quantum analog, commonly known as quantum neural networks (QNNs), are widely being investigated. Despite the significant interest, the literature still lacks some concrete evidence about QNN's superiority over their classical counterparts, especially in practical applications. This paper empirically demonstrates a greater capacity in hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNNs) for a practical application, namely multi-class classification. In particular, we train both the HQNNs and their equivalent classical counterparts on the same data. We then benchmark the models' accuracy for quantifying model's capacity, where greater accuracy typically implies greater capacity. The results demonstrate a clear quantum advantage, i.e., greater capacity of HQNNs over their classical counterparts, where the HQNN models constantly achieve better accuracy. This superiority in performance by HQNNs serves as a foundational study for further investigation to magnify the quantum advantage in real-world applications of HQNNs.  © 2022 IEEE.",Hybrid algorithms; Quantum advantage; Quantum computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum neural networks,Classification (of information); Neural network models; Qubits; Classical counterpart; Hybrid algorithms; Machine-learning; Performance; Quantum advantage; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum neural networks; Research areas; Machine learning,Conference paper

The variational quantum circuit (VQC) is frequently utilized to build a quantum neural network (QNN), which is a counterpart to the conventional neural network. Due to hardware limitations, however, current quantum devices only allow one to use few qubits to represent data and perform simple quantum computations. The limited quantum resource on a single quantum device degrades the data usage and limits the scale of the quantum circuits, preventing quantum advantage to some extent. To alleviate this constraint, we propose an approach to implementing a scalable quantum neural network (SQNN) by utilizing the quantum resource of multiple small-size quantum devices cooperatively. In an SQNN system, several quantum devices are used as quantum feature extractors, extracting local features from an input instance in parallel, and a quantum device works as a quantum predictor, performing prediction over the local features collected through classical communication channels. The quantum feature extractors in the SQNN system are independent of each other, so one can flexibly use quantum devices of varying sizes, with larger quantum devices extracting more local features. Especially, the SQNN can be performed on a single quantum device in a modular fashion. Our work is exploratory and carried out on a quantum system simulator using the TensorFlow Quantum library. The evaluation conducts a binary classification on the MNIST dataset. It shows that the SQNN model achieves a comparable classification accuracy to a regular QNN model of the same scale. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the SQNN model with more quantum resources can significantly improve classification accuracy.  © 2022 IEEE.",Distributed Quantum computing; Quantum Machine Learning; Quantum Neural Networks; Variational Quantum Circuits,Classification (of information); Machine learning; Quantum optics; Qubits; Timing circuits; Classification accuracy; Distributed quantum computing; Machine-learning; Quantum circuit; Quantum device; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum neural networks; Quantum resources; Variational quantum circuit; Neural network models,Conference paper

This becomes even more important for quantum machine learning models implemented on noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Encoding high dimensional data into a quantum circuit for a NISQ device without any loss of information is not trivial and brings a lot of challenges. While simple encoding schemes (like single qubit rotational gates to encode high dimensional data) often lead to information loss within the circuit, complex encoding schemes with entanglement and data re-uploading lead to an increase in the encoding gate count. This is not well-suited for NISQ devices. This work proposes 'incremental data-uploading', a novel encoding pattern for high dimensional data that tackles these challenges.

With the recent rise in popularity of quantum computing algorithms and public availability of first-generation quantum hardware, it is of interest to assess their potential for efficiently handling large quantities of operational data for PHM purposes. This paper addresses the application of quantum kernel classification models for fault detection in wind turbine systems (WTSs).

This work aims to explore potential advantages of quantum kernel methods, such as quantum support vector machines (Q‐SVMs), over traditional ML approaches and compare principal component analysis (PCA) and autoencoders (AE) as feature reduction tools. Results show that the proposed quantum approach is comparable to conventional ML models in terms of performance and can outperform traditional models (random forest, k‐nearest neighbors) for the selected reduced dimensionality of 19 features for both PCA and AE.

A suitable design strategy is variational circuits where parameters of circuits are determined through training, an approach that conforms with characteristics of machine learning applications. In this paper, we propose a low-depth and implementation-efficient non-linear activation function for quantum neural networks (QNNs). The building block of a quantum circuit is quantum gate which is a unitary operation. Thus, building a non-linear component out of quantum gates is challenging. While the majority of prior works used measurement as the source of non-linearity, this method has limited ability in classifying datasets. We propose a quantum circuit for the popular Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. Our proposed circuit is based on low-cost quantum gates that can be synthesized into primitive gates in contemporary quantum computers. We exploit QNNs that rely on quantum rotation to define decision boundaries for classification problems. In addition, we use controlled quantum gates to detect correlation in data through entanglement of qubits. Our evaluations reveal that QNNs equipped with our proposed quantum ReLU perform well on standard benchmark datasets while requiring dramatically fewer number of epochs for training compared with classical neural networks. In addition, we run QNNs with different number of quantum layers on an IBM quantum computer and show that our proposed circuits are practical and generate meaningful results on real quantum computers. © 2022 IEEE.",activation function; NISQ devices; quantum machine learning; quantum neural networks,Chemical activation; Classification (of information); Logic gates; Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Activation functions; Machine-learning; NISQ device; Nonlinear activation functions; Quanta computers; Quantum circuit; Quantum gates; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum neural networks; Machine learning,Conference paper

In fact, recent works have shown strong evidence that quantum computers could outperform classical computers in solving certain notable machine learning tasks. Yet, quantum learning systems may also suffer from the vulnerability problem: adding a tiny carefully crafted perturbation to the legitimate input data would cause the systems to make incorrect predictions at a notably high confidence level. In this paper, we study the universality of adversarial examples and perturbations for quantum classifiers. Through concrete examples involving classifications of real-life images and quantum phases of matter, we show that there exist universal adversarial examples that can fool a set of different quantum classifiers. We prove that, for a set of k classifiers with each receiving input data of n qubits, an O(ln [k]/2n) increase of the perturbation strength is enough to ensure a moderate universal adversarial risk. In addition, for a given quantum classifier, we show that there exist universal adversarial perturbations, which can be added to different legitimate samples to make them adversarial examples for the classifier.

In this exploratory study, we assess a PQC for classifying a two-label EO image dataset and compare it with a classic deep learning classifier. We use the PQC with an input space of only 17 quantum bits (qubits) due to the current limitations of quantum technology. As a real-world image for EO, we selected the Eurosat dataset obtained from multispectral Sentinel-2 images as a training dataset and a Sentinel-2 image of Berlin, Germany, as a test image. However, the high dimensionality of our images is incompatible with the PQC input domain of 17 qubits. Hence, we had to reduce the dimensionality of the input images for this two-label case to a vector with 16 elements; the 17th qubit remains reserved for storing label information. We employed a very deep convolutional network with an autoencoder as a technique for the dimensionality reduction of the input image, and we mapped the dimensionally reduced image onto 16 qubits by means of parameter thresholding. Then, we used a PQC to classify the two-label content of the dimensionally reduced Eurosat image dataset. A PQC classifies the Eurosat images with high accuracy as a classic deep learning method (and with even better accuracy in some instances). From our experiment, we derived and enhanced deeper insight into programming future gate-based quantum computers for many practical problems in EO.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",Earth observation (EO); parameterized quantum circuit (PQC); quantum machine learning (QML),Classification (of information); Computer programming; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Dimensionality reduction; Learning systems; Quantum channel; Qubits; Remote sensing; Statistical tests; Classification of remote sensing image; Convolutional networks; Earth observations; Exploratory studies; High dimensionality; Learning classifiers; Practical problems; Quantum technologies; image analysis; image classification; parameterization; remote sensing; Image classification,Article

This problem impacts the accuracy and the reliability in image classification tasks for critical applications, such as in healthcare. The proposed approach builds on the classical ReLU and Leaky ReLU, applying the quantum principles of entanglement and superposition at a computational level to derive two novel AFs, respectively the ‘Quantum ReLU’ (QReLU) and the ‘modified-QReLU’ (m-QReLU). The proposed AFs were validated when coupled with a CNN using seven image datasets on classification tasks involving the detection of COVID-19 and Parkinson's Disease (PD). The out-of-sample/test classification accuracy and reliability (precision, recall and F1-score) of the CNN were compared against those of the same classifier when using nine classical AFs, including ReLU-based variations. Findings indicate higher accuracy and reliability for the CNN when using either QReLU or m-QReLU on five of the seven datasets evaluated. Whilst retaining the best classification accuracy and reliability for handwritten digits recognition on the MNIST dataset (ACC = 99%, F1-score = 99%), avoiding the ‘dying ReLU’ problem via the proposed quantum AFs improved recognition of PD-related patterns from spiral drawings with the QReLU especially, which achieved the highest classification accuracy and reliability (ACC = 92%, F1-score = 93%).

Machine learning algorithms are ubiquitous in particle physics and as advances are made in quantum machine learning technology there may be a similar adoption of these quantum techniques. In this work a quantum support vector machine (QSVM) is implemented for signal-background classification. We investigate the effect of different quantum encoding circuits, the process that transforms classical data into a quantum state, on the final classification performance. We show an encoding approach that achieves an average Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.848 determined using quantum circuit simulations. For this same dataset the best classical method tested, a classical Support Vector Machine (SVM) using the Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel achieved an AUC of 0.793. Using a reduced version of the dataset we then ran the algorithm on the IBM Quantum ibmq_casablanca device achieving an average AUC of 0.703. As further improvements to the error rates and availability of quantum computers materialise, they could form a new approach for data analysis in high energy physics. © 2021, The Author(s).",Belle II; Continuum suppression; Particle physics; Quantum machine learning; Quantum support vector machines,,Article

The proposed approach exploits the analogy between the intrinsic correlation of two or more particles and the dependence of each HTTP request on the preceding ones. Starting from the a-posteriori probability of each request to belong to a particular class, it is possible to assign a Qubit state representing a combination of the aforementioned probabilities for all available observations of the time series. By leveraging the underlying mathematical details of superposition and entanglement on specific subsequences, it is possible to devise a measure of membership to each class, thus enabling the system to take a reliable decision when a sufficient level of confidence is met or to continue with additional observations.

Thanks to the exploitation of kernel functions, SVM succeeds to address also complex classification tasks involving non-linearly separable data. However, there are limitations to its success when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. Quantum-enhanced Support Vector Machine (QSVM) utilizes the properties of quantum computers to obtain an exponential speed up with respect to the conventional SVM by using the quantum state space as the feature space. Unfortunately, to benefit from these advantages, currently, it is necessary to have a background knowledge about quantum computing concepts and specific language skills. The goal of this paper is to introduce a web-based tool to make simple to all researchers, coming from several and heterogeneous scientific backgrounds, the application of QSVM to different real-world classification problems.

But is the ability of a quantum circuit to uniformly address the Hilbert space a good indicator of classification accuracy? In our work, we use methods and quantifications from prior art to perform a numerical study in order to evaluate the level of correlation. We find a moderate to strong correlation between the ability of the circuit to uniformly address the Hilbert space and the achieved classification accuracy for circuits that entail a single embedding layer followed by 1 or 2 circuit designs. This is based on our study encompassing 19 circuits in both 1- and 2-layer configurations, evaluated on 9 datasets of increasing difficulty.

Does the model generalize? This is the main question in any data-driven strategy, namely the ability to predict the correct class even of previously unseen states. Here we establish a link between quantum classification and quantum information theory, by showing that the accuracy and generalization capability of quantum classifiers depend on the (Rényi) mutual information I(C:Q) and I2(X:Q) between the quantum state space Q and the classical parameter space X or class space C. Based on the above characterization, we then show how different properties of Q affect classification accuracy and generalization, such as the dimension of the Hilbert space, the amount of noise, and the amount of neglected information from X via, e.g., pooling layers. Moreover, we introduce a quantum version of the information bottleneck principle that allows us to explore the various trade-offs between accuracy and generalization.

Classical computers are having computational limitations in terms of large volume data processing. Quantum machine are not to replace classical machines but quantum computers will solve operational difficulties of classical machines in terms of computational time. Quantum machine learning accelerates the supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning methods. Classical ML methods such as SVM, PCA, Clustering, Neural networks are giving promising results but classical machines are inadequate to perform certain computations.

Support vector machine (SVM) is proved to be one of the most efficient classification machine learning algorithms in today’s world. Since in classical systems, as datasets become complex or mixed up, the SVM kernel approach tends to slow and might fail. Hence our research is focused to examine the execution speed and accuracy of quantum support vector machines classification compared to classical SVM classification by proper quantum feature mapping selection. As the size of the dataset becomes complex, a proper feature map has to be selected to outperform or equally perform the classification. Hence the paper focuses on the selection of the best feature map for some benchmark datasets. Additionally experimental results show that the processing time of the algorithm is considerably reduced concerning classical machine learning.

However the ambitious HL-LHC program will require much more computing resources in the next two decades. Quantum computing may offer speed-up for HEP physics analyses at HL-LHC, and can be a new computational paradigm for big data analyses in High Energy Physics. We have successfully employed three methods (1) Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) method, (2) Quantum Support Vector Machine Kernel (QSVM-kernel) method and (3) Quantum Neural Network (QNN) method for two LHC flagship analyses: ttH (Higgs production in association with two top quarks) and H->mumu (Higgs decay to two muons, the second generation fermions). We shall address the progressive improvements in performance from method (1) to method (3). We will present our experiences and results of a study on LHC High Energy Physics data analyses with IBM Quantum Simulator and Quantum Hardware (using IBM Qiskit framework), Google Quantum Simulator (using Google Cirq framework), and Amazon Quantum Simulator (using Amazon Braket cloud service). The work is in the context of a Qubit platform (a gate-model quantum computer). Taking into account the present limitation of hardware access, different quantum machine learning methods are studied on simulators and the results are compared with classical machine learning methods (BDT, classical Support Vector Machine and classical Neural Network). Furthermore, we do apply quantum machine learning on IBM quantum hardware to compare performance between quantum simulator and quantum hardware.

This work pioneers a close collaboration of academic institutions with industrial corporations in the High Energy Physics analyses effort. Though the size of event samples in future HL-LHC physics and the limited number of qubits pose some challenges to the Quantum Machine learning studies for High Energy Physics, more advanced quantum computers with larger number of qubits, reduced noise and improved running time (as envisioned by IBM and Google) may outperform classical machine learning in both classification power and in speed.

However, achieving a quantum advantage on present-day quantum computers remains an open challenge. In this work, we primarily focus on solving machine learning problems using a hybrid model based on both quantum and classical computers together for the classification task. We propose the quantum multi-class classifier (QMCC) as a variational circuit with a hybrid classical-quantum approach using quantum mechanical properties such as superposition and entanglement. A unitary operation on a single qubit for the state preparation is designed and also demonstrated using a real quantum computer on the IBMQX platform. The entire variational circuit for the classification task is implemented on a quantum simulator. We performed our quantum simulations on three benchmark datasets: Iris dataset, Banknote Authentication (BNA) dataset, and Wireless Indoor Localization (WIL) dataset for machine learning algorithms. Our simulation results show that the proposed QMCC model classified Iris dataset with an accuracy of 92.10%, BNA dataset with an accuracy of 89.50%, and WIL dataset with an accuracy of 91.73%.

A concrete example toward this goal is the quantum neural network (QNN), which has been developed to accomplish various supervised learning tasks such as classification and regression. However, there are two central issues that remain obscure when QNN is exploited to accomplish classification tasks. First, a quantum classifier that can well balance the computational cost such as the number of measurements and the learning performance is unexplored. Second, it is unclear whether quantum classifiers can be applied to solve certain problems that outperform their classical counterparts. Here we devise a Grover-search based quantum learning scheme (GBLS) to address the above two issues. Notably, most existing QNN-based quantum classifiers can be seamlessly embedded into the proposed scheme. The key insight behind our proposal is reformulating the classification tasks as the search problem. Numerical simulations exhibit that GBLS can achieve comparable performance with other quantum classifiers under various noise settings, while the required number of measurements is dramatically reduced. We further demonstrate a potential quantum advantage of GBLS over classical classifiers in the measure of query complexity.

Previous work for mitigating noise has primarily focused on gate-level or pulse-level noise-adaptive compilation. However, limited research has explored a higher level of optimization by making the quantum circuits themselves resilient to noise.In this paper, we propose QuantumNAS, a comprehensive framework for noise-adaptive co-search of the variational circuit and qubit mapping. Variational quantum circuits are a promising approach for constructing quantum neural networks for machine learning and variational ansatzes for quantum simulation. However, finding the best variational circuit and its optimal parameters is challenging due to the large design space and parameter training cost. We propose to decouple the circuit search from parameter training by introducing a novel SuperCircuit. The SuperCircuit is constructed with multiple layers of pre-defined parameterized gates (e.g., U3 and CU3) and trained by iteratively sampling and updating the parameter subsets (SubCircuits) of it. It provides an accurate estimation of SubCircuits performance trained from scratch. Then we perform an evolutionary co-search of SubCircuit and its qubit mapping. The SubCircuit performance is estimated with parameters inherited from SuperCircuit and simulated with real device noise models. Finally, we perform iterative gate pruning and finetuning to remove redundant gates in a fine-grained manner.Extensively evaluated with 12 quantum machine learning (QML) and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) benchmarks on 14 quantum computers, QuantumNAS significantly outperforms noise-unaware search, human, random, and existing noise-adaptive qubit mapping baselines. For QML tasks, QuantumNAS is the first to demonstrate over 95% 2-class, 85% 4-class, and 32% 10-class classification accuracy on real quantum computers. It also achieves the lowest eigenvalue for VQE tasks on H2, H2O, LiH, CH4, BeH2 compared with UCCSD baselines.

In this paper, we study thermal imaging as an environment localization task, in which thermal images are modeled as ensembles of Gaussian phase insensitive channels with identical transmissivity, and pixels possess properties according to background (cold) or target (warm) thermal channels. Via the teleportation stretching of adaptive quantum protocols, we derive ultimate limits on the precision of pattern classification of abstract, binary thermal image spaces, and show that quantum-enhanced strategies may be used to provide significant quantum advantage over known optimal classical strategies.

The search for ideal QML models is an active research field. This includes identification of efficient classical-to-quantum data encoding scheme, construction of parametric quantum circuits (PQC) with optimal expressivity and entanglement capability, and efficient output decoding scheme to minimize the required number of measurements, to name a few. However, most of the empirical/numerical studies lack a clear path towards scalability. Any potential benefit observed in a simulated environment may diminish in practical applications due to the limitations of noisy quantum hardware (e.g., under decoherence, gate-errors, and crosstalk). We present a scalable quantum-classical hybrid deep neural network (DeepQMLP) architecture inspired by classical deep neural network architectures. In DeepQMLP, stacked shallow Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models mimic the hidden layers of a classical feed-forward multi-layer perceptron network. Each QNN layer produces a new and potentially rich representation of the input data for the next layer. This new representation can be tuned by the parameters of the circuit. Shallow QNN models experience less decoherence, gate errors, etc. which make them (and the network) more resilient to quantum noise. We present numerical studies on a variety of classification problems to show the trainability of DeepQMLP. We also show that DeepQMLP performs reasonably well on unseen data and exhibits greater resilience to noise over QNN models that use a deep quantum circuit.

Also, training such models with multiple layers becomes complex as many trainable parameters are to be optimized. Quantum computing emerged as a research area to handle complex problems using quantum-mechanical properties for computation on a quantum computer. In this work, we primarily focus on designing a hybrid quantum-classical deep learning model for image scene classification. We propose a novel hybrid architecture that uses quantum computation for feature extraction and classical computation for scene classification. In the hybrid architecture, we use quantum measurement-based features to obtain the quantum representations of images. The obtained quantum representations of images are used to train and build a classical deep learning model for image scene classification. Our experiments performed on ibm_santiago quantum computer show that the proposed model is suitable for implementation on noisy intermediate scaled quantum computers. Our experimental results show that the proposed model can classify data efficiently using trainable parameters ≈ 27–30% less than the state-of-the-art models on satellite image datasets.

In 2017, Duan et al. proposed a quantum algorithm for support matrix machines (QSMM) that efficiently addresses image classification problems. The QSMM consists of two core subroutines: an HHL algorithm and a quantum singularity threshold (QSVT) algorithm with complexities of O[κ3ϵ- 3log (Nmn)] and O[log (mn)] , respectively, where κ is the condition number of the corresponding matrix of the HHL algorithm, ϵ is the expected accuracy of the output state, N is the number of samples in the training set and mn is the size of the feature space. The QSMM achieves an exponential increase in speed over classical counterparts. However, we find that Duan’s QSMM can be improved by applying an improved quantum matrix inversion (QMI) algorithm instead of the HHL algorithm. Compared with that of Duan’s QSMM, the dependence on precision of our improved QSMM (IQSMM) is exponentially improved, and the complexity of our first subroutine is as low as O[κ2log 1.5(κ/ ϵ) log (Nmn)]. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Quantum algorithm; Quantum computation; Quantum machine learning,Matrix algebra; Number theory; Binary classification; Classical counterpart; Condition numbers; Exponential increase; Image technology; Matrix inversions; Number of samples; Quantum algorithms; Quantum theory,Article

In quantum theory, a large number of experimental results show that quantum correlation is far stronger than what can be explained by local hidden theory (i.e., classical or non-quantum theory), that is, quantum mechanics theory reveals a statistical correlation stronger than that described by classical theory. Based on this, this paper will use the strong statistical correlation revealed by Bell state to build a classification algorithm to verify the validity and superiority of the formal framework of quantum mechanics in specific classification tasks. Specifically, we use quantum joint probabilities derived from the measurement process of Bell state to model the quantum statistical correlation between features and categories.

A more severe vulnerability has been noted for quantum machine learning (QML) models classifying Haar-random pure states. This stems from the concentration of measure phenomenon, a property of the metric space when sampled probabilistically, and is independent of the classification protocol. To provide insights into the adversarial robustness of a quantum classifier on real-world classification tasks, we focus on the adversarial robustness in classifying a subset of encoded states that are smoothly generated from a Gaussian latent space. We show that the vulnerability of this task is considerably weaker than that of classifying Haar-random pure states. In particular, we find only mildly polynomially decreasing robustness in the number of qubits, in contrast to the exponentially decreasing robustness when classifying Haar-random pure states and suggesting that QML models can be useful for real-world classification tasks. © 2021 American Physical Society.",,Machine learning; Classical neural networks; Classification tasks; Concentration of measure; Metric spaces; Pure state; Quantum machines; Real-world; State of the art; Quantum theory,Article

Late detection of DR can lead to irreversible blindness. The manual diagnosis process of DR retina fundus images by ophthalmologists is time consuming and costly. While, Classical Transfer learning models are extensively used for computer aided detection of DR; however, their maintenance costs limits detection performance rate. Therefore, Quantum Transfer learning is a better option to address this problem in an optimized manner. The significance of Hybrid quantum transfer learning approach includes that it performs heuristically. Thus, our proposed methodology aims to detect DR using a hybrid quantum transfer learning approach.

In medical imaging research, image processing techniques tend to be vital in analyzing and resolving diseases with a high degree of accuracy. This paper establishes a new image classification and segmentation method through simulation techniques, conducted over images of COVID-19 patients in India, introducing the use of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in medical practice. Methods: This study establishes a prototype model for classifying COVID-19, comparing it with non-COVID pneumonia signals in Computed tomography (CT) images. The simulation work evaluates the usage of quantum machine learning algorithms, while assessing the efficacy for deep learning models for image classification problems, and thereby establishes performance quality that is required for improved prediction rate when dealing with complex clinical image data exhibiting high biases. Results: The study considers a novel algorithmic implementation leveraging quantum neural network (QNN). The proposed model outperformed the conventional deep learning models for specific classification task. The performance was evident because of the efficiency of quantum simulation and faster convergence property solving for an optimization problem for network training particularly for large-scale biased image classification task. The model run-time observed on quantum optimized hardware was 52 min, while on K80 GPU hardware it was 1 h 30 min for similar sample size. The simulation shows that QNN outperforms DNN, CNN, 2D CNN by more than 2.92% in gain in accuracy measure with an average recall of around 97.7%.

As such, many endeavors have been made to accelerate the optimization of modern VQAs in past years. To further improve the capability of VQAs, here, we propose a quantum distributed optimization scheme (dubbed as QUDIO), whose back ends support both real quantum devices and various quantum simulators. Unlike traditional VQAs subsuming a single quantum chip or simulator, QUDIO collaborates with multiple quantum machines or simulators to complete learning tasks. In doing so, the required wall-clock time for optimization can be continuously reduced by increasing the accessible computational resources when ignoring the communication and synchronization time. Moreover, through the lens of optimization theory, we unveil the potential factors that could affect the convergence of QUDIO. In addition, we systematically understand the ability of QUDIO to reduce wall-clock time via two standard benchmarks, which are hand-written image classification and the ground energy estimation of the dihydrogen.

Availability of the first quantum processor led to further research, particularly exploring possible practical applications of QML algorithms in the remote sensing field. The demand for extensive field data for remote sensing applications has started creating bottlenecks for classical machine learning algorithms. QML is becoming a potential solution to tackle big data problems as it can learn from fewer data. This paper presents a QML model based on a quantum support vector machine (QSVM) to classify Holm Oak trees using PRISMA hyperspectral Imagery. Implementation of quantum models was carried on a quantum simulator and a real-time superconducting quantum processor of IBM. The performance of the QML model is validated in terms of dataset size, overall accuracy, number of qubits, training and predicting speed. Results were indicative that (i) QSVM offered 5% higher accuracy than classical SVM (CSVM) with 50 samples and ≥12 qubits/feature dimensions whereas with 20 samples at 16 Qubits/feature dimension, (ii) training time for QSVM at maximum accuracy was 284 s with 50 samples and with 20 samples was 53.68 s and (iii) predicting time for 400 pixels using the QSVM model trained with 50 samples dataset was 5243 s whereas with 20 samples dataset was 2845 s. Results were indicative that QML offers better accuracy but lack training and predicting speed for hyperspectral data. Another observation is that predicting speed of QSVM depends on the number of samples used to train the model. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Classification; hyperspectral imagery; IBM simulator; PRISMA; quantum; support vector machine,Classification (of information); Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Image classification; Learning algorithms; Qubits; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Hyper-spectral imageries; IBM simulator; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; PRISMA; Quantum; Quantum machines; Quantum processors; Support vectors machine; accuracy assessment; algorithm; data processing; deciduous tree; image classification; multispectral image; remote sensing; support vector machine; trade-off; Support vector machines,Article

Furthermore, the processing of classical data and machine learning algorithms in the quantum domain has given rise to an emerging field like quantum machine learning. Recently, quantum machine learning has become quite a challenging field in the case of healthcare applications. As a result, quantum machine learning has become a common and effective technique for data processing and classification across a wide range of domains.

However, most application systems detect duplicitous activities after they have already occurred, not at or near real time. Since spurious transactions are far fewer than the normal ones, the highly imbalanced data makes fraud detection very challenging and calls for ways to address it beyond the traditional machine learning approach. This study has proposed a detection framework, and implemented it using quantum machine learning (QML) approach by applying Support Vector Machine (SVM) enhanced with quantum annealing solvers. To evaluate its detection performance, we have further implemented twelve machine learning methods, and compared the performance of QML application with these machine learning implementations on two datasets: Israel credit card transactions (non-time series) which is moderately imbalanced, and a bank loan dataset (time series) that is highly imbalanced. The result shows that, the quantum enhanced SVM has categorically outperformed the rest in both speed and accuracy with the bank loan dataset. However, its detection accuracy is similar to others with Israel credit card transactions data. Furthermore, for both datasets, feature selection has been shown to significantly improve the detection speed, although the improvement on accuracy is marginal. These findings have demonstrated the potential of QML applications on time series based, highly imbalanced data, and the merit of traditional machine learning approaches in non-time series data.

The advantage stems from quantum feature maps encoding the inputs into quantum states with variational quantum circuits. A recent work shows how to map discrete features with fewer quantum bits using Quantum Random Access Coding (QRAC) to encode binary strings into quantum states. We propose a new method to embed discrete features with trainable quantum circuits by combining QRAC and a recently proposed strategy for training quantum feature map called quantum metric learning. The proposed trainable embedding requires not only as few qubits as QRAC but also overcomes the limitations of QRAC to classify inputs whose classes are based on hard Boolean functions.

Several methods have been proposed on how to address this topic, but graph comparison still presents many challenges. Recently, information physics has emerged as a promising theoretical foundation for complex networks. In many applications, it has been demonstrated that natural complex systems exhibit features that can be described and interpreted by measures typically applied in quantum mechanical systems. Therefore, a natural starting point for the identification of network similarity measures is information physics and a series of measures of distance for quantum states.

Most of these algorithms are either heuristic or assume that data can be accessed quantum-mechanically, making it unclear whether a quantum advantage can be proven without resorting to strong assumptions. Here we construct a classification problem with which we can rigorously show that heuristic quantum kernel methods can provide an end-to-end quantum speed-up with only classical access to data. To prove the quantum speed-up, we construct a family of datasets and show that no classical learner can classify the data inverse-polynomially better than random guessing, assuming the widely believed hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. Furthermore, we construct a family of parameterized unitary circuits, which can be efficiently implemented on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, and use them to map the data samples to a quantum feature space and estimate the kernel entries. The resulting quantum classifier achieves high accuracy and is robust against additive errors in the kernel entries that arise from finite sampling statistics. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,Classification (of information); Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Inverse problems; Learning systems; Quantum computers; Sampling; Supervised learning; Additive errors; Classical counterpart; Discrete logarithm problems; Fault-tolerant; Finite sampling; Quantum features; Quantum machines; Supervised machine learning; Learning algorithms,Article

One area of considerable interest is the use of QML to learn information contained within quantum states themselves. In this work, we propose a novel approach in which the extraction of information from quantum states is undertaken in a classical representational-space, obtained through the training of a hybrid quantum autoencoder (HQA). Hence, given a set of pure states, this variational QML algorithm learns to identify - and classically represent - their essential distinguishing characteristics, subsequently giving rise to a new paradigm for clustering and semi-supervised classification. The analysis and employment of the HQA model are presented in the context of amplitude encoded states - which in principle can be extended to arbitrary states for the analysis of structure in non-trivial quantum data sets. © 2021 The Author(s).

Due to its unique advantages in information storage and processing, quantum information processing has become the most popular research field. Quantum theory also provides us with new methods or concepts for information manipulation and processing. The basic problems of classical physics are basically trying to be solved in a situation of isolation from the surrounding environment to reduce the complexity of the analysis problem, but the quantum system inevitably produces decoherence and establishes a close relationship with the environment such as entanglement, so the formal framework of quantum mechanics is inherently capable of depicting complex relationships. Based on the principle of quantum open system, a classifier under the formal framework of quantum mechanics is established to simulate the evolution process of open systems, that is, the interaction process between the target system and the environment. Specifically, we regard the features (or attributes) of the sample as environmental factors that affect the decision-making of the target system, and the target system can obtain the categories (or labels) of the sample through measurement. Based on this, we use the formal framework of quantum mechanics to establish a more natural and tighter correspondence between attributes and labels. Limited by the limitations of simulating quantum operations on classical computers, we conducted experiments on two lightweight machine learning datasets and compared them with mainstream classification algorithms. Experimental results show that the classification algorithm is better than the comparison models, and it also reveals the potential of the algorithm. © 2021 IEEE.",Quantum Classification Algorithm; Quantum Machine Learning; Quantum Open System,Behavioral research; Classification (of information); Decision making; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mechanics; Open systems; Quantum optics; Classification algorithm; Formal framework; Machine-learning; Quantum classification algorithm; Quantum information processing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum open systems; Research fields; Target systems; Quantum entanglement,Conference paper

There are both fundamentally new algorithms, such as HHL, and quantum-improved ones: QPCA, QSVM. In this article, we will look at the QSVM algorithm step by step, starting from the basics described in section 2 and gradually delving into the composition of the algorithm. Thus, after the basics, we will consider the quantum phase estimation, which is part of the HHL algorithm, and then the QSVM algorithm, the component of which is the HHL. We also will consider the QPCA algorithm, which can be applied before the QSVM algorithm to reduce the dimension of the data sample. In this way, we explore the fundamental difference between classical algorithms and their quantum counterparts. We also implement the QSVM method in practice and compare the obtained practical results with theory. As a result, we obtained high quality of accuracy (100 %) compared to the classical SVM (83 %) on a data sample of dimension 72. However, we found out that the learning time on a quantum device is far from ideal (it can reach 5 min for a sample of this size). The study aims to theoretically argue or disprove the hypothesis about the efficiency of quantum computing for machine learning algorithms. The object of research is the programming of quantum computers. The research subject is the study of quantum computing mechanisms for the implementation of machine learning problems. The research result is a software module that allows evaluating the efficiency of the classification task on a quantum computer. It also can be used to compare the results obtained from classical and quantum devices.

Quantum computation has the potential to significantly enhance existing classical machine learning methods, and several quantum algorithms for binary classification based on the kernel method have been proposed. These algorithms rely on estimating an expectation value, which in turn requires an expensive quantum data encoding procedure to be repeated many times. In this work, we calculate explicitly the number of repetition necessary for acquiring a fixed success probability and show that the Hadamard-test and the swap-test circuits achieve the optimal variance in terms of the quantum circuit parameters. The variance, and hence the number of repetition, can be further reduced only via optimization over data-related parameters. We also show that the kernel-based binary classification can be performed with a single-qubit measurement regardless of the number and the dimension of the data. Finally, we show that for a number of relevant noise models the classification can be performed reliably without quantum error correction. Our findings are useful for designing quantum classification experiments under limited resources, which is the common challenge in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. © 2021 IEEE.",binary classifier; NISQ; Quantum computing; quantum machine learning,Classification (of information); Machine learning; Quantum theory; Qubits; Binary classification; Binary classifiers; Computational costs; Kernel-methods; Machine learning methods; NISQ; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Theoretical research; Error correction,Conference paper

The quantum generative adversarial network (QGAN) is considered to be one of the quantum machine learning algorithms with great application prospects, which also should be improved to conform to the human-centered paradigm. The generation process of QGAN is relatively random and the generated model does not conform to the human-centered concept, so it is not quite suitable for real scenarios. In order to solve these problems, a hybrid quantum-classical conditional generative adversarial network (QCGAN) algorithm is proposed, which is a knowledge-driven human–computer interaction computing mode that can be implemented in cloud. The purposes of stabilizing the generation process and realizing the interaction between human and computing process are achieved by inputting artificial conditional information in the generator and discriminator. The generator uses the parameterized quantum circuit with an all-to-all connected topology, which facilitates the tuning of network parameters during the training process. The discriminator uses the classical neural network, which effectively avoids the “input bottleneck” of quantum machine learning. Finally, the BAS training set is selected to conduct experiment on the quantum cloud computing platform.

Variational methods that use quantum resources of imperfect quantum devices with the help of classical computing techniques are popular for supervised learning. Variational quantum classification (VQC) is one of such methods with possible quantum advantage in using quantum-enhanced features that are hard to compute by classical methods. Its performance depends on the mapping of classical features into a quantum-enhanced feature space. Although there have been many quantum-mapping functions proposed so far, there is little discussion on efficient mapping of discrete features, such as age group, zip code, and others, which are often significant for classifying datasets of interest. We first introduce the use of quantum random-access coding (QRAC) to map such discrete features efficiently into limited number of qubits for VQC. In numerical simulations, we present a range of encoding strategies and demonstrate their limitations and capabilities. We experimentally show that QRAC can help speeding up the training of VQC by reducing its parameters via saving on the number of qubits for the mapping. We confirm the effectiveness of the QRAC in VQC by experimenting on classification of real-world datasets with both simulators and real quantum devices. © 2021 by the Author(s).",Discrete features; quantum machine learning; quantum random-access coding (QRAC); supervised learning; variational quantum algorithms,Encoding (symbols); Learning algorithms; Mapping; Quantum efficiency; Quantum theory; Qubits; Signal encoding; Supervised learning; Variational techniques; Discrete feature; Encodings; Machine-learning; Quantum algorithms; Quantum device; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum random-access coding; Random access; Variational quantum algorithm; Classification (of information),Article

In order to ameliorate some of these challenges, we investigate a layerwise learning strategy for parametrized quantum circuits. The circuit depth is incrementally grown during optimization, and only subsets of parameters are updated in each training step. We show that when considering sampling noise, this strategy can help avoid the problem of barren plateaus of the error surface due to the low depth of circuits, low number of parameters trained in one step, and larger magnitude of gradients compared to training the full circuit. These properties make our algorithm preferable for execution on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We demonstrate our approach on an image-classification task on handwritten digits, and show that layerwise learning attains an 8% lower generalization error on average in comparison to standard learning schemes for training quantum circuits of the same size. Additionally, the percentage of runs that reach lower test errors is up to 40% larger compared to training the full circuit, which is susceptible to creeping onto a plateau during training. © 2021, The Author(s).",Gate model quantum computing; Parametrized quantum circuit; Quantum machine learning; Quantum neural network,Character recognition; Cost functions; Errors; Quantum theory; Generalization Error; Handwritten digit; Learning schemes; Learning strategy; Quantum circuit; Quantum device; Quantum neural networks; Sampling noise; Multilayer neural networks,Article

Biomedical data characterizing complex diseases such as cancer typically require an algorithmic support for clinical decisions, especially for early stage tumors that typify breast cancer patients, which are still controllable in a therapeutic and surgical way. Our case study consists of the prediction during the pre-operative stage of lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients resulting in a negative diagnosis after clinical and radiological exams. The classifier adopted to establish a baseline is characterized by the result invariance for the order permutation of the input features, and it exploits stratifications in the training procedure. The quantum one mimics support vector machine mapping in a high-dimensional feature space, yielded by encoding into qubits, while being characterized by complexity. Feature selection is exploited to study the performances associated with a low number of features, thus implemented in a feasible time. Wide variations in sensitivity and specificity are observed in the selected optimal classifiers during cross-validations for both classification system types, with an easier detection of negative or positive cases depending on the choice between the two training schemes. Clinical practice is still far from being reached, even if the flexible structure of quantum-inspired classifier circuits guarantees further developments to rule interactions among features: this preliminary study is solely intended to provide an overview of the particular tree tensor network scheme in a simplified version adopting just product states, as well as to introduce typical machine learning procedures consisting of feature selection and classifier performance evaluation. © 2021 by the authors.

Learning in this space occurs through applying a low-depth quantum circuit with a tree-tensor-network (TTN) topology acting as an unsupervised feature extractor to identify the most relevant quantum states in a data-driven fashion and then applying a supervised linear classifier encoding the class decision in a small-dimensional quantum register. We present tools for making TTN classifiers amenable to implementation on gate-based quantum computing devices, including an embedding map with accuracy similar to the recently defined exponential machines (A. Novikov, arXiv:1605.03795) but which produces valid quantum state embeddings of classical data vectors, and the use of manifold-based gradient optimization schemes to produce isometric operations mapping quantum states to a register of qubits defining a class decision. We detail methods for efficiently obtaining one-point and two-point correlation functions of the vectors defining the decision boundary of the quantum model, which can be used for model interpretability, as well as methods for obtaining classification decisions from partial data vectors. Further, we show that the use of isometric tensors can significantly aid in the human interpretability of the correlation functions extracted from the decision weights and may produce models that are less susceptible to adversarial perturbations. Finally, we discuss in detail the problem of compiling classically optimized isometric TTN models into unitary operations to be run on quantum computers and how isometric models requiring postselection on quantum hardware can be used to precondition variational Ansätze for models without postselection.

However, the success of this field, as seen over the past decade, has resulted in the complexity of modern methodologies scaling exponentially, commonly requiring millions of parameters. Quantum computing (QC) is an active area of research aimed toward greatly reducing problems of complexity faced in classical computing. With growing interest toward quantum machine learning (QML) for applications of image classification, many proposed algorithms require usage of numerous qubits. In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, these circuits may not always be feasible to execute effectively; therefore, we should aim to use each qubit as effectively and efficiently as possible, before adding additional qubits. This article proposes a new single-qubit-based deep quantum neural network for image classification that mimics traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques, resulting in a reduced number of parameters compared with previous works. Our aim is to prove the concept of the initial proposal by demonstrating classification performance of the single-qubit-based architecture, as well as to provide a tested foundation for further development. To demonstrate this, our experiments were conducted using various datasets including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and ORL face datasets. To further our proposal in the context of the NISQ era, our experiments were intentionally conducted in noisy simulation environments. Initial test results appear promising, with classification accuracies of 94.6%, 89.5%, and 82.5% achieved on the subsets of MNIST, FMNIST, and ORL face datasets, respectively. In addition, proposals for further investigation and development were considered, where it is hoped that these initial results can be improved.

First, the classical EEG signal dataset is prepared as a quantum state while the sign of the data point is preserved. The prepared quantum state is then evolved with the quantum wavelet packet transformation (QWPT) and the wavelet packet energy entropy (WPEE) feature is extracted as the input of the subsequent quantum classifier.

Variational quantum algorithms have gained popularity due to their resilience to error, which is a common occurrence in the near term intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. In such an algorithm, an optimal function is mapped by a quantum circuit which is designed using weighted parameterized gates to be trained based on a cost function that is optimized using gradient descent. A Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) is such an algorithm and is used for supervised learning to perform data classification. But since the quantum hardware available today is not powerful enough for a VQC to come of any practical use in the current setting, we implement a transfer learning pipeline in which a pre-trained image processing model is fine tuned using a dressed VQC; for a specific, binary classification task. Our aim was to study the working of a VQC and test it’s behaviour with respect to multiple hyperparameters such as circuit depth, number of qubits, etc. We trained our transfer learning-VQC model for 4 different datasets and for different hyperparameters and were able to get close to state of the art performance in most of our tests, solidifying the prospect of VQC as an efficient quantum-classical hybrid supervised learning algorithm.

In order to develop defense mechanisms and to better understand the reliability of these algorithms, it is crucial to understand their robustness properties in the presence of natural noise sources or adversarial manipulation. From the observation that measurements involved in quantum classification algorithms are naturally probabilistic, we uncover and formalize a fundamental link between binary quantum hypothesis testing and provably robust quantum classification. This link leads to a tight robustness condition that puts constraints on the amount of noise a classifier can tolerate, independent of whether the noise source is natural or adversarial. Based on this result, we develop practical protocols to optimally certify robustness.

In neu-romorphic/emerging-hardware-based implementations of neural network algorithms, the non-linear activation function is often implemented through dedicated analog electronics. This enables faster execution of the activation function during training and inference of neural networks compared to conventional digital implementation. Here, with a similar motivation, we propose a novel non-linear activation function that can be used in a neural network for data classification. Our activation function can be implemented by taking advantage of the inherent nonlinearity in qubit preparation and SU(2) operation in quantum mechanics. These operations are directly implementable on quantum hardware through single-qubit quantum gates as we show here. In addition, the SU(2) parameters are adjustable here making the activation function adaptable; we adjust the parameters through classical feedback like in a variational algorithm in quantum machine learning. Using our proposed quantum activation function, we report accurate classification using popular machine learning data sets like Fisher's Iris, Wisconsin's Breast Cancer (WBC), Abalone, and MNIST on three different platforms: simulations on a classical computer, simulations on a quantum simulation framework like Qiskit, and experimental implementation on quantum hardware (IBM-Q). Then we use a Bloch-sphere-based approach to intuitively explain how our proposed quantum activation function, with its adaptability, helps in data classification. © 2021 IEEE.",neural network; neuromorphic computing; quantum machine learning,Chemical activation; Classification (of information); Computer hardware; Computer software; Machine learning; Pattern recognition; Quantum theory; Qubits; Simulation platform; Activation functions; Analog electronics; Data classification; Data patterns; Integral components; Neural networks algorithms; Neural-networks; Neuromorphic computing; Nonlinear activation functions; Quantum machine learning; Quantum chemistry,Conference paper

Recently, some QML models were proposed for performing classification tasks, however, they rely on centralized solutions that cannot scale well for distributed quantum networks. Hence, it is apropos to consider more practical quantum federated learning (QFL) solutions tailored towards emerging quantum networks to allow for distributing quantum learning. This paper proposes the first fully quantum federated learning framework that can operate over purely quantum data. First, the proposed framework generates the first quantum federated dataset in literature. Then, quantum clients share the learning of quantum circuit parameters in a decentralized manner.

Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous in pattern recognition, with support vector machines (SVMs) being the best known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such classification problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element in the computational speed-ups enabled by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here we propose and experimentally implement two quantum algorithms on a superconducting processor. A key component in both methods is the use of the quantum state space as feature space. The use of a quantum-enhanced feature space that is only efficiently accessible on a quantum computer provides a possible path to quantum advantage. The algorithms solve a problem of supervised learning: the construction of a classifier. One method, the quantum variational classifier, uses a variational quantum circuit1,2 to classify the data in a way similar to the method of conventional SVMs. The other method, a quantum kernel estimator, estimates the kernel function on the quantum computer and optimizes a classical SVM. The two methods provide tools for exploring the applications of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers3 to machine learning. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,controlled study; kernel method; Letter; machine learning; mathematical computing; mathematical model; priority journal; process development; process optimization; quantum mechanics,Article

Our two-photon proposal encodes data points in a discrete, eight-dimensional feature Hilbert space. In order to maximize the application range of the deployable kernels, we optimize feature maps towards the resulting kernels’ ability to separate points, i.e., their “resolution,” under the constraint of finite, fixed Hilbert space dimension. Implementing these kernels, our setup delivers viable decision boundaries for standard nonlinear supervised classification tasks in feature space.

The increase in demand can be met by integrating Distributed Generators (DG) into the distribution system. Optimal location and capacity of DG plays an important role in distribution network to minimize the power losses. Some researchers have studied this important optimization problem with constant power load which is independent of voltage. However, majority of consumers at load center uses voltage dependent load models, which are primarily dependent on magnitude of supply voltage. In practical distribution network, the assumption of constant power load can significantly affect the location and size of DG, which in turn can lead to higher power losses and poor voltage regulation. In this study, an investigation has been performed to find the increase in power loss due to the use of inappropriate load models, while solving the optimization problem. Furthermore, an attempt has been made in this study to reduce power losses occurring in large test bus systems with loads being dependent on voltage rather than the constant power load. Different test cases are created to analyse the power losses with appropriate load model and in-appropriate load model (constant power load model). The load at distribution network is not mainly dependent on any single type of load model, it is a combination of all load models. In this study, a class of mix load viz., combination of residential, industrial, constant power, and commercial load, is also considered. In order to solve this critical combinatorial optimization problem with voltage dependent load model, which requires an extensive search, Adaptive Quantum inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (AQiEA) is used. The proposed algorithm uses entanglement and superposition principles, which does not require an operator to avoid premature convergence and tuning parameters for improving the convergence rate. A Quantum Rotation inspired Adaptive Crossover operator has been used as a variation operator for a better convergence. The effectiveness of AQiEA is demonstrated and computer simulations are carried out on two standard benchmark large test bus systems viz., 85 bus system and 118 bus system. In addition to AQiEA, four other algorithms (Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), and Ecogeography-based Optimization (EBO) with Classification based on Multiple Association Rules (CMAR)) have also been employed for comparison. Tabulated results show that the location and size of DGs determined using in-appropriate load model (constant power load model) has significantly high power losses when applied in distribution system with different load model (other voltage dependent load models) as compared with the location and size of DGs determined using the appropriate load model. Experimental results indicate that AQiEA has a better performance compared to other algorithms which are available in the literature. © 2020",Commercial Load; Distributed Generator; Industrial Load; Power Loss; Residential Load; Voltage Dependent Load,,Article

In this paper, we propose a new hybrid quantum-classical framework for supervised quantum learning, which we call Variational Shadow Quantum Learning (VSQL). Our method in particular utilizes the classical shadows of quantum data, which fundamentally represent the side information of quantum data with respect to certain physical observables. Specifically, we first use variational shadow quantum circuits to extract classical features in a convolution way and then utilize a fully-connected neural network to complete the classification task. We show that this method could sharply reduce the number of parameters and thus better facilitate quantum circuit training. Simultaneously, less noise will be introduced since fewer quantum gates are employed in such shadow circuits. Moreover, we show that the Barren Plateau issue, a significant gradient vanishing problem in quantum machine learning, could be avoided in VSQL. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of VSQL in quantum classification via numerical experiments on the classification of quantum states and the recognition of multi-labeled handwritten digits. In particular, our VSQL approach outperforms existing variational quantum classifiers in the test accuracy in the binary case of handwritten digit recognition and notably requires much fewer parameters.

Data reuploading is a QML algorithm with a focus on utilizing the power of a singular qubit as an individually capable classifier. Recently, there have been studies set out to explore the concept of data re-uploading in a classification setting, however, important aspects are often not considered in experiments, which may hinder our understanding of the methodology's performance. In this work, we conduct an analysis of the single-qubit data re-uploading methodology, in relation to the effect that system depth has on classification and robustness performances against the influence of environmental noise during training. This is aimed towards bridging together previous works in order to solidify the concepts of the methodology, and provide reasonable insight into how transferable the methodology is when applied to non-synthetic data. To further demonstrate the findings, we also analyse the results of a case study using a subset of MNIST data. From this work, our experimental results support that an increase in system depth can lead to higher classification performances, as well as improved stability during training in noisy environments, with the sharpest performance improvements seemingly occurring between 1-3 uploading layer repetitions. Leading on from our experimental results, we suggest areas for further exploration, to ensure we can maximize classification performance when using the data re-uploading methodology.  © 2013 IEEE.",data re-uploading; Machine learning; quantum computing; quantum machine learning,Machine learning; Qubits; Classification performance; Environmental noise; Noisy environment; Performance enhancements; Quantum machines; Single qubits; Synthetic data; Classification (of information),Article

These transforms appear in many problems related to classification/clustering, regression, system identification, system inversion, and input signal restoration/separation. We here analyze the connections between all these problems in the classical and quantum frameworks. We then focus on their most challenging versions, involving quantum data and/or quantum processing means, and unsupervised, i.e., blind, learning. We consider the general single-preparation quantum information processing (SIPQIP) framework that we have recently proposed. It involves methods that can work with a single instance of each (unknown) state, whereas usual methods are quite cumbersome because they have to very accurately create many copies of each (known) state. In our previous papers, we applied the SIPQIP approach to only one task [blind quantum process tomography (BQPT)], but it opens the way to a large range of other types of methods. In this article, we, therefore, propose various new SIPQIP methods that efficiently perform tasks related to system identification (blind Hamiltonian parameter estimation (BHPE), blind quantum channel identification/estimation, and blind phase estimation), system inversion and state estimation (blind quantum source separation (BQSS), blind quantum entangled state restoration (BQSR), and blind quantum channel equalization), and classification. Numerical tests show that our SIPQIP framework, moreover, yields much more accurate estimation than the usual multiple-preparation approach. Our methods are especially useful in a quantum computer, which we propose to more briefly call a 'quamputer': BQPT and BHPE simplify the characterization of quamputer gates; BQSS and BQSR yield quantum gates that may be used to compensate for the nonidealities that alter states stored in quantum registers and open the way to very general self-adaptive quantum gates. © 2020 IEEE.",Blind Hamiltonian parameter estimation (BHPE); blind quantum process tomography (BQPT); blind quantum source separation (BQSS); blind quantum state restoration (BQSR); blind/unsupervised quantum machine learning; Heisenberg exchange coupling; quantum classification; quantum computer (quamputer); single-preparation quantum information processing (SIPQIP); spin-based qubits,Blind equalization; Blind source separation; Classification (of information); Hamiltonians; Machine learning; Parameter estimation; Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Religious buildings; Restoration; Signal reconstruction; Tomography; Blind hamiltonian parameter estimation; Blind quantum process tomography; Blind quantum source separation; Blind quantum source separations; Blind quantum state restoration; Blind/unsupervised quantum machine learning; Hamiltonian parameters; Heisenberg exchange; Heisenberg exchange coupling; Parameters estimation; Quanta computers; Quantum classification; Quantum computer; Quantum information processing; Quantum process tomography; Quantum state; Single-preparation quantum information processing; Spin-based qubit; State restoration; Quantum optics,Article

SVM has been used immensely to assist a precise classification of a data point. The kernel trick of SVM has also elevated the performance of the classical algorithm. But, SVM suffers a lot of problems on a classical machine when higher dimensions are introduced or large datasets are taken up. So, in order to enhance the efficiency of Support Vector Machine, the idea of running it on a quantum machine takes over.A Quantum Machine uses Qubits which is a single bit representing 0, 1 and superposition states of 0 & 1. This use of Qubit introduces the concept of ‘parallel processing’. The Quantum Machine utilises a different version of the SVM algorithm for performing the task of classification. In the algorithm, classical data is transformed into quantum data and then analysed over a Quantum Machine. For this experiment, the outcomes from both Classical Machine as well as Quantum Machine will be compared to determine Quantum Machine’s precedence over Classical Machine is justified or not. The comparison parameters are execution time and accuracy percentile of both the approaches. These results will be compared for asserting the importance of Quantum Approach in increasing machine learning’s scope, application and potential for current, future and deemed impossible task. © BEIESP.",Quantum machine; Quantum machine learning; Quantum support vector machine; Support vector machine,,Article

Because the hybrid framework consists of the parametrized quantum circuit and well-developed classical optimizers, the selection of appropriate optimizer for different task matters the final performance of the model. In this paper, we take nine widely employed optimizers, including gradient based and gradient-free based, into account, and present the empirical comparison between their performance on a typical scenario, i.e. supervised learning. In our experiments, we found the gradient based optimizer provides a relatively better solution in each case.

Dimensionality reduction of a dataset with a suitable feature selection strategy is one of the most important tasks in knowledge discovery and data mining. The efficient feature selection strategy helps to improve the overall accuracy of a large dataset in terms of machine learning operations. In this paper, a quantum feature selection algorithm using a graph-theoretic approach has been proposed. The proposed algorithm has used the concept of correlation coefficient based graph-theoretic classical approach initially and then applied the quantum Oracle with CNOT operation to verify whether the dataset is suitable for dimensionality reduction or not.

A requirement for using quantum computing in machine learning techniques is the data representation as quantum states. In Quantum Machine Learning, quantum state preparation is paramount to attain a functional pipeline in a model. One state preparation method, amplitude encoding, allows a dataset to be mapped or encoded more robustly and enhances the learning of quantum models. Albeit more densely represented, a dataset which has been prepared by amplitude encoding provides a more learnable input to a model. The two main advantages from using amplitude encoding are an increase in classification accuracy and reduced variability of learning epoch to epoch. In this paper, we compare the basic implementations of TensorFlow Quantum's Quantum Convolutional Neural Network and a hybrid quantum-classical network using angle encoding, with a third network of our design that utilizes amplitude encoding for enriched state preparation.

The proposed method is based on implements a quantum clustering approach to represent gene-expression data as equations and uses the procedure to search for the most probable set of clusters given the available data. The main contribution of this approach lies in the ability to take into account the essential features or genes using clustering. Here, we present a novel clustering approach that extends ideas from scale-space clustering and support-vector clustering. This clustering method is used as a feature selection method. Our approach is fundamentally based on the representation of datapoints or features in the Hilbert space, which is then represented by the Schrödinger equation, of which the probability function is a solution. This Schrödinger equation contains a potential function that is extended from the initial probability function.The minima of the potential values are then treated as cluster centres. The cluster centres thus stand out as representative genes. These genes are evaluated using classifiers, and their performance is recorded over various indices of classification. From the experiments, it is found that the classification performance of the reduced set is much better than the entire dataset.The only free-scale parameter, sigma, is then altered to obtain the highest accuracy, and the corresponding biological significance of the genes is noted. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.",k-NN; Microarray data; Quantum clustering; Random forest; Schrödinger equation; SVM,Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Decision trees; Gene expression; Nearest neighbor search; Random forests; Vector spaces; Classification performance; Dinger equation; Feature selection methods; Microarray data; Microarray gene expression; Quantum clustering; Support vector clustering; Unsupervised approaches; Support vector machines,Conference paper

With applied quantum computing in its infancy, there already exist quantum machine learning models such as variational quantum eigensolvers which have been used e.g. in the context of energy minimization tasks. Yet, to date, no viable recurrent quantum network has been proposed. In this work we construct the first quantum recurrent neural network (QRNN) with demonstrable performance on non-trivial tasks such as sequence learning and integer digit classification. The QRNN cell is built from parametrized quantum neurons, which, in conjunction with amplitude amplification, creates a nonlinear activation of polynomials of its inputs and cell state, and allows the extraction of a probability distribution over predicted classes at each step. To study the model’s performance, we provide an implementation in pytorch, which allows the relatively efficient optimization of parametrized quantum circuits with tens of thousands of parameters, and which demonstrates that the model does not appear to suffer from the vanishing gradient problem that plagues many existing quantum classifiers and classical RNNs. We establish a QRNN training setup by benchmarking optimization hyperparameters, and analyse suitable network topologies for simple memorisation and sequence prediction tasks from Elman’s seminal paper (1990). We then proceed to evaluate the QRNN on MNIST classification, by feeding the QRNN each image pixel-by-pixel; with a network utilizing only 12 qubits we reach a test set accuracy over 95% when discriminating between the digits ‘0’ and ‘1’. © 2020 Neural information processing systems foundation.

We interpret the process of encoding inputs in a quantum state as a nonlinear feature map that maps data to quantum Hilbert space. A quantum computer can now analyze the input data in this feature space. Based on this link, we discuss two approaches for building a quantum model for classification. In the first approach, the quantum device estimates inner products of quantum states to compute a classically intractable kernel. The kernel can be fed into any classical kernel method such as a support vector machine. In the second approach, we use a variational quantum circuit as a linear model that classifies data explicitly in Hilbert space.

The strategy is first to map the classical data onto the states in a many-body Hilbert space and then to capture these states with tensor network schemes. We adopt the TN in the form of matrix product states as an example to implement GTNC where the testing images are classified by comparing the fidelities between different states. Our results show that GTNC has a very impressive performance on benchmark datasets in comparison to several well-known machine learning models.

There-fore, it is of great importance to detect electricity theft from both an economic and social perspective. With the help of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) in smart grids, now it is possible to detect theft activities through analyzing the recorded electricity consuming data using advanced techniques, such as machine learning. However, training a learning model, especially for the ones with a huge amount of parameters, is always resource-consuming, and users could encounter performance bottlenecks due to hardware limitations. To improve the problem, using quantum computing for machine learning tasks has shown to be an effective approach to speed up the learning process.

They allow to deal with quantum transport phenomena and are an advanced tool for constructing novel quantum algorithms. Quantum walks on graphs are fundamentally different from classical random walks analogs, in particular, they walk faster than classical ones on certain graphs, enabling in these cases quantum algorithmic applications and quantum-enhanced energy transfer. However, little is known about the possible advantages on arbitrary graphs not having explicit symmetries. For these graphs one would need to perform simulations of classical and quantum walk dynamics to check if the speedup occurs, which could take a long computational time. Here we present a new approach for the solution of the quantum speedup problem, which is based on a machine learning algorithm that predicts the quantum advantage by just 'looking' at a graph. The convolutional neural network, which we designed specifically to learn from graphs, observes simulated examples and learns complex features of graphs that lead to a quantum advantage, allowing to identify graphs that exhibit quantum advantage without performing any quantum walk or random walk simulations. The performance of our approach is evaluated for line and random graphs, where classification was always better than random guess even for the most challenging cases. Our findings pave the way to an automated elaboration of novel large-scale quantum circuits utilizing quantum walk based algorithms, and to simulating high-efficiency energy transfer in biophotonics and material science. © 2019 The Author(s).

We show that quantum learning yields results that can be significantly more accurate than the classical maximum likelihood approach, both for unsupervised learning and for classification. The data density matrix and the QBM solution show entanglement, quantified by the quantum mutual information I. The classical mutual information in the data I c I/2 = C, with C maximal classical correlations obtained by choosing a suitable orthogonal measurement basis.

In this work, we generalize this theoretical model to the multipartite setting of barcode decoding and pattern recognition. We start by defining a digital image as an array or grid of pixels, each pixel corresponding to an ensemble of quantum channels. Specializing each pixel to a black and white alphabet, we naturally define an optical model of a barcode. In this scenario, we show that the use of quantum entangled sources, combined with suitable measurements and data processing, greatly outperforms classical coherent-state strategies for the tasks of barcode data decoding and classification of black and white patterns. Moreover, introducing relevant bounds, we show that the problem of pattern recognition is significantly simpler than barcode decoding, as long as the minimum Hamming distance between images from different classes is large enough. Finally, we theoretically demonstrate the advantage of using quantum sensors for pattern recognition with the nearest-neighbor classifier, a supervised learning algorithm, and numerically verify this prediction for handwritten digit classification.  © 2020 American Physical Society.",,Bar codes; Character recognition; Data handling; Decoding; Hamming distance; Learning algorithms; Pixels; Handwritten digit classification; Minimum hamming distances; Nearest Neighbor classifier; Optical modeling; Quantum entangled; Quantum hypothesis; Quantum information theory; Theoretical modeling; Quantum entanglement,Article

But the architecture of CNN such as LetNet and AlexNet were designed elaborately by experts because designing the neural networks is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. This paper proposed a quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm to search the neural architectures. First, we encode CNNs into quantum chromosomes and distinguish these chromosomes from the Convolutional Layer, Pooling Layer, Fully-connected Layer and Disabled Layer with its range. Second, quantum chromosomes are updated by applying quantum gates and find the best individual with quantum genetic algorithm. Third, we can predict the network performance after a few steps of stochastic gradient descent by means of evaluation estimate strategy so that we can stop training the bad networks early, which can speed up evolutionary process. The proposed algorithm is examined and compared with some state-of-art methods for image classification in three benchmark datasets. The experimental results prove the proposed algorithm can search a strong classifier robustly. In addition, it performs better than the general evolutionary algorithm. More importantly, with the help of evaluation estimate strategy, it is substantially faster than the algorithms without evaluation estimate strategy which means we can take less time to search a good network for the given task. © 2020 IEEE.",evaluation estimate; genetic algorithm; neural architecture search; quantum-inspired,Arts computing; Chromosomes; Classification (of information); Convolution; Deep learning; Genetic algorithms; Gradient methods; Image classification; Learning systems; Network architecture; Stochastic systems; Benchmark datasets; Evolutionary process; Neural architectures; Quantum chromosomes; Quantum genetic algorithm; Quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm; State-of-art methods; Stochastic gradient descent; Convolutional neural networks,Conference paper

Since dimensionality grows exponentially with the number of qubits, the potential power of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices over classical resources also stems from entangled states in high dimensions. An important family of quantum protocols that can take advantage of high-dimensional Hilbert space is classification tasks. These include quantum machine learning algorithms, witnesses in quantum information processing, and certain decision problems. However, due to counterintuitive geometrical properties emergent in high dimensions, classification problems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We demonstrate that the amount of perturbation needed for an adversary to induce a misclassification scales inversely with dimensionality. This is shown to be a fundamental feature independent of the details of the classification protocol. Furthermore, this leads to a tradeoff between the security of the classification algorithm against adversarial attacks and quantum advantages that we expect for high-dimensional problems. In fact, protection against these adversarial attacks requires extra resources that can even scale polynomially with the Hilbert space dimension of the system, which can erase any significant quantum advantage that we might expect from a quantum protocol. This has wide-ranging implications in the use of both near-term and future quantum technologies for classification.  © 2020 American Physical Society",,Hilbert spaces; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Vector spaces; Classification algorithm; Classification tasks; Fundamental features; Geometrical property; High-dimensional problems; Misclassifications; Quantum technologies; Quantum-information processing; Classification (of information),Article

We introduce “single-shot training”, where all input samples belonging to the same class are used to train the classifier simultaneously. This significantly speeds up the training procedure and provides an advantage over classical machine learning classifiers.

The running time of the quantum classifier is only polylogarithmic in the dimension and number of data points. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the other parameters on which the running time depends scale favorably, ascertaining the efficiency of our algorithm. © 2020 American Physical Society.",,Character recognition; Dimensionality reduction; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Statistical tests; Classification accuracy; Handwritten digit; Number of datum; Polylogarithmic; Quantum algorithms; Quantum machines; Real-world problem; Slow feature analysis; Classification (of information),Article

However, some of these spectral bands are redundant and/or noisy, and hence, selecting highly informative and trustworthy bands for each class is a vital step for classification and for saving internal storage space; then the selected bands are termed a highly informative spectral band subset. We use a mutual information (MI)-based method to select the spectral band subset of a given class and two additional binary quantum classifiers, namely a quantum boost (Qboost) and a quantum boost plus (Qboost-Plus) classifier, to classify a two-label dataset characterized by the selected band subset. We pose both our MI-based band subset selection problem and the binary quantum classifiers as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. Such a quadratic problem is solvable with the help of conventional optimization techniques. However, the QUBO problem is an NP-hard global optimization problem, and hence, it is worthwhile for applying a quantum annealer. Thus, we adapted our MI-based optimization problem for selecting highly informative bands for each class of a given HSI to be run on a D-Wave quantum annealer. After the selection of these highly informative bands for each class, we employ our binary quantum classifiers to a two-label dataset on the D-Wave quantum annealer. In addition, we provide a novel multilabel classifier exploiting an error-encoding output code when using our binary quantum classifiers. As a real-world dataset in Earth observation, we used the well-known AVIRIS HSI of Indian Pine, north-western Indiana, USA. We can demonstrate that the MI-based band subset selection problem can be run on a D-Wave quantum annealer that selects the highly informative spectral band subset for each target class in the Indian Pine HSI.

The objective of the proposed work was to train a simple machine learning algorithm on a hybrid quantum computer/simulator to evaluate whether the hybrid quantum computer would be trained with higher accuracy compared to a conventional computer. The diabetics’ dataset was used to train a logistic regression model as a binary classifier. Two qubits were used for implementing the QML algorithm on a quantum simulator. The Quantum kitchen sinks employ the quantum circuits which are used to nonlinearly tranform standard inputs into features that can be utilized by numerous machine learning algorithms.

There are quantum neurons that can carry an exponential amount of information to a linear number of quantum information units (qubits) using the quantum property of superposition. In this paper, we compare the performance of three of these quantum neuron models applied to the diabetes classification problem. We also propose the use of different data preprocessing strategies. Quantum neurons were simulated using the IBM Qiskit tool. We compare the preprocessing approaches applied to two toy problems (1) simulating the XOR operator and (2) solving a generic nonlinear problem. The results of the experiments shows that a single quantum neuron is capable of achieving an accuracy rate of 100% in the XOR problem and an accuracy rate of 100% in a non-linear dataset, demonstrating that the quantum neurons with real weights are capable of modeling non-linearly separable problems. In the problem of diagnosing diabetes, quantum neurons achieved an accuracy rate of 76% and AUC-ROC of 88%, while its classic version, the perceptron, reached only 63% accuracy and the artificial neural network reached 80% AUC-ROC.

The various configurations of HNN were investigated where QC with different number of qubits were used and compared. The HNN configurations were trained, validated, and tested on the more complex CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets in addition to our previous attempts on the simpler MNIST, notMNIST, MNIST Fashion datasets.

It is a daunting task for the researchers to find suitable infection patterns on lung CT images for automated diagnosis of COVID-19. A novel integrated semi-supervised shallow neural network framework comprising a Parallel Quantum-Inspired Self-supervised Network (PQIS-Net) for automatic segmentation of lung CT images followed by Fully Connected (FC) layers, is proposed in this article. The proposed PQIS-Net model is aimed at providing fully automated segmentation of lung CT slices without incorporating pre-trained convolutional neural network based models. A parallel trinity of layered structure of quantum bits are interconnected using an N -connected second order neighborhood-based topology in the suggested PQIS-Net architecture for segmentation of lung CT slices with wide variations of local intensities. A random patch-based classification on PQIS-Net segmented slices is incorporated at the classification layers of the suggested semi-supervised shallow neural network framework. Intensive experiments have been conducted using three publicly available data sets, one for purely segmentation task and the other two for classification (COVID-19 diagnosis). The experimental outcome on segmentation of CT slices using self-supervised PQIS-Net and the diagnosis efficiency (Accuracy, Precision and AUC) of the integrated semi-supervised shallow framework is found to be promising.

In particular, employing this algorithm for feature selection as a wrapper technique in Brain-Computer Interfaces applications was recently proposed with great results. Moreover, the training time of the model was decreased while maintaining a high classification accuracy, both essential conditions for a successful BCI. The drawback of this model was the sensitiveness to changes in the direction and magnitude of the rotation angle, which can produce adverse effects in both performance and convergence time. Chaotic systems and Evolutionary algorithms, when combined, can enhance the convergence rate and speed of the evolutionary process, incrementing the capacity of reaching the global optima. In this paper we explore the effects of adding ergodicity to a QiEA by the employment of chaotic maps in two operators: chaotic uniform crossover and chaotic quantum update gate. To validate the proposed approach, six commonly used chaotic maps are tested with data of Motor Imagery (MI) Electroencephalography (EEG) of right and left hand movement. The results of these experiments are compared with the ones of a QiEA and a classical Genetic Algorithm (GA). In the proposed model, Wavelet Packet Decomposition is employed as the time-frequency analysis to characterize the signal, whereas a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network is used as a classifier. The results demonstrated that Chaotic QiEAs can significantly improve the convergence time of the model with only a small loss in the final accuracy. © 2020 IEEE.",BCI applications; Chaotic maps; Feature selection; Motor Imagery classification; Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm,Chaotic systems; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Lyapunov methods; Multilayer neural networks; Wavelet decomposition; Classification accuracy; Convergence rates; Evolutionary process; Multi-layer perceptron neural networks; Quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm; Time frequency analysis; Uniform crossovers; Wavelet Packet Decomposition; Brain computer interface,Conference paper

Quantum-inspired algorithms were born when there were no quantum computers; they demonstrated to have interesting characteristics providing good results in classical computers. At present, when the first quantum computers are available, scientists are working to confirm the quantum supremacy in different fields. After almost 20 years that the first metaheuristic inspired in quantum phenomena was published, a large number of works have been proposed. This paper aims to look back to see which quantum-inspired metaheuristics could be translated to be used in the existing quantum computers based on the circuit model programming paradigm. Reviewed metaheuristics were classified according to their main source of inspiration; just some representative works of each classification were selected because of the vast number of existing works on each one. The analysis was done for the circuit model and metrics as width, size, and length were used to determine their viability of being implemented in a real quantum computer. Moreover, comparative results using metrics such as performance and running time for quantum-inspired metaheuristic were included. © 2019 IEEE.",binary coded quantum-inspired metaheuristic; circuit model; metaheuristic for quantum computer; Quantum metaheuristic; quantum-inspired; real coded quantum-inspired metaheuristic,Circuit simulation; Computer programming; Heuristic algorithms; Qubits; Circuit modeling; Meta heuristics; Metaheuristic; Programming paradigms; Quantum phenomena; quantum-inspired; Running time; Computer circuits,Article

When it comes to communication, reliability in an AMC is very critical. Increasing the amount of signals exponentially increases the cost of using the AMC. Precise classification methods, such as neural network, in which either the parameters of the neural network or the dimensions of the input or output variables are modified dynamically, are not successful in obtaining high accuracy results. To improve the accuracy of the modulation categorization, this study employs a ""QIGA"" feature selection model based on Quantum (inspired) Genetic Algorithm (QIGA). QIGA is used to choose the correct functionality, and to limit the number of examples that must be learned so that the overall system time is shortened and the cost of computing is reduced. Selecting excellent characteristics is enhanced via quantum computing, and this is done to lower the complexity of the solutions.

The field is attracting ever-increasing attention from both academic and private sectors, as testified by the recent demonstration of quantum supremacy in practice. However, the intrinsic restriction to linear operations significantly limits the range of relevant use cases for the application of Quantum Computing. In this work, we introduce a novel variational algorithm for quantum Single Layer Perceptron. Thanks to the universal approximation theorem, and given that the number of hidden neurons scales exponentially with the number of qubits, our framework opens to the possibility of approximating any function on quantum computers. Thus, the proposed approach produces a model with substantial descriptive power, and widens the horizon of potential applications already in the NISQ era, especially the ones related to Quantum Artificial Intelligence.

A recent work shows how to map discrete features with fewer quantum bits using Quantum Random Access Coding (QRAC), an important primitive to encode binary strings into quantum states. We propose a new method to embed discrete features with trainable quantum circuits by combining QRAC and a recently proposed strategy for training quantum feature map called quantum metric learning. We show that the proposed trainable embedding requires not only as few qubits as QRAC but also overcomes the limitations of QRAC to classify inputs whose classes are based on hard Boolean functions.

Quantum machine learning (QML) has the potential to revolutionize image classification. In any typical DL-based image classification, we use convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the image and multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) to create the actual decision boundaries. QML models can be useful in both of these tasks. On one hand, convolution with parameterized quantum circuits (Quanvolution) can extract rich features from the images. On the other hand, quantum neural network (QNN) models can create complex decision boundaries. Therefore, Quanvolution and QNN can be used to create an end-to-end QML model for image classification. Alternatively, we can extract image features separately using classical dimension reduction techniques such as, Principal Components Analysis (PCA) or Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) and use the extracted features to train a QNN. We review two proposals on quantum-classical hybrid ML models for image classification namely, Quanvolutional Neural Network and dimension reduction using a classical algorithm followed by QNN. Particularly, we make a case for trainable filters in Quanvolution and CAE-based feature extraction for image datasets (instead of dimension reduction using linear transformations such as, PCA). We discuss various design choices, potential opportunities, and drawbacks of these models. We also release a Python-based framework to create and explore these hybrid models with a variety of design choices. ©2021 IEEE",,Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Linear transformations; Multilayer neural networks; Network layers; Principal component analysis; Applications domains; Auto encoders; Decision boundary; Dimension reduction; Hybrid machine learning; Images classification; Machine learning models; Principal-component analysis; Quantum neural networks; Quantum-classical; Image classification,Conference paper

We encode each training sample as a string of 1 s (presence) and 0 s (absence) representing the attribute’s existence across ordered physical blocks of the subdivided genome. Having binary-valued features allows for highly efficient data encoding in the computational basis for classifiers relying on binary operations. Given that a natural distance between binary strings is Hamming distance, which shares properties with bit-string inner products, our two classifiers apply different inner product measures for classification. The active inner product (AIP) is a direct dot product–based classifier whereas the symmetric inner product (SIP) classifies upon scoring correspondingly matching genomic attributes. SIP is a strongly Hamming distance–based classifier generally applicable to binary attribute-matching problems whereas AIP has general applications as a simple dot product–based classifier. The classifiers implement an inner product between N = 2n dimension test and train vectors using n Fredkin gates while the training sets are respectively entangled with the class-label qubit, without use of an ancilla. Moreover, each training class can be composed of an arbitrary number m of samples that can be classically summed into one input string to effectively execute all test–train inner products simultaneously. Thus, our circuits require the same number of qubits for any number of training samples and are O(log N) in gate complexity after the states are prepared.

Variational methods that use quantum resources of imperfect quantum devices with the help of classical computing techniques are popular for supervised learning. Variational Quantum Classification (VQC) is one of such variational methods with possible quantum advantage in using quantum-enhanced features that are hard to compute by classical methods. Its performance depends on the mapping of classical features into quantum-enhanced feature space. Although there have been many quantum-mapping functions proposed so far, there is little discussion on efficient mapping of discrete features, such as, race, gender, marriage status and others that are often significant for classifying datasets of interest. We first introduce the use of Quantum Random Access Coding (QRAC) to map such discrete features efficiently into limited number of qubits for VQC. We numerically show that QRAC can help speeding up the training of VQC by reducing its parameters via reduction on the number of qubits for the mapping. We confirm the effectiveness of the QRAC in VQC by experimenting on classification of healthcare datasets with both simulators and real quantum devices. © 2020 IEEE.",discrete features; quantum machine learning; quantum random access coding; supervised learning; variational quantum algorithms,Learning systems; Mapping; Quantum theory; Qubits; Signal encoding; Variational techniques; Classical computing; Classical methods; Feature space; Mapping functions; Quantum device; Quantum resources; Random access; Variational methods; Classification (of information),Conference paper

However reported applications usually employ synthetic or well-known datasets. One of these techniques based on using a hybrid approach combining quantum and classic devices is the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), which development seems promising.Albeit being largely studied, VQC implementations for ""real-world"" datasets are still challenging on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum devices (NISQ). In this paper we propose a preprocessing pipeline based on Stokes parameters for data mapping. This pipeline enhances the prediction rates when applying VQC techniques, improving the feasibility of solving classification problems using NISQ devices. By including feature selection techniques and geometrical transformations, enhanced quantum state preparation is achieved.Also, a representation based on the Stokes parameters in the Poincare Sphere is possible for visualizing the data.Our results showthat by using the proposed techniques we improve the classification score for the incidence of acute comorbid diseases in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients.

It plays a vital role in various machine learning applications and recently has attracted tremendous attention across different communities. In this paper, we explore different adversarial scenarios in the context of quantum machine learning. We find that, similar to traditional classifiers based on classical neural networks, quantum learning systems are likewise vulnerable to crafted adversarial examples, independent of whether the input data is classical or quantum. In particular, we find that a quantum classifier that achieves nearly the state-of-the-art accuracy can be conclusively deceived by adversarial examples obtained via adding imperceptible perturbations to the original legitimate samples. This is explicitly demonstrated with quantum adversarial learning in different scenarios, including classifying real-life images (e.g., handwritten digit images in the dataset MNIST), learning phases of matter (such as ferromagnetic/paramagnetic orders and symmetry protected topological phases), and classifying quantum data. Furthermore, we show that based on the information of the adversarial examples at hand, practical defense strategies can be designed to fight against a number of different attacks. Our results uncover the notable vulnerability of quantum machine learning systems to adversarial perturbations, which not only reveals another perspective in bridging machine learning and quantum physics in theory but also provides valuable guidance for practical applications of quantum classifiers based on both near-term and future quantum technologies. © 2020 authors.

The problem occurs when data samples have an uneven distribution amongst the classes and classical classifiers are not suitable for classifying such datasets. To overcome this problem, in this paper, the best training samples are selected from data samples with the goal of improving the performance of classifier when dealing with imbalanced data. To do so, some heuristic methods are presented which use local information to give a proper view about whether removing or retaining each sample of training set. Subsequently, the methods are considered as local search algorithms and combined with a global search algorithm in a framework to form memetic algorithms. The global search used in this paper is binary quantum inspired gravitational search algorithm (BQIGSA) which is a new metaheuristic search for optimization of binary encoded problems. BQIGSA is employed since we seek for a highly stochastic and random search algorithm to solve our problem. We propose to use six different local search algorithms, three of which are application oriented that we designed based on the problem and the rest are general, and the best local search is then determined. Experiments are performed on 45 standard datasets, and G-mean and AUC criteria are considered as evaluation tools. Then, the data sets are employed to compare the best memetic approaches with some popular state of the art algorithms as well as a recently proposed memetic algorithm and the results show their superiority. At the last step, the performance of the proposed algorithm for four different classifiers is evaluated and the best classifier is determined to be utilized for this method. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Binary quantum-inspired gravitational search algorithm; Imbalanced data; Memetic algorithms; Metaheuristics; Training set selection; Under-sampling methods,Genetic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Learning algorithms; Local search (optimization); Machine learning; Stochastic systems; Gravitational search algorithms; Imbalanced data; Memetic algorithms; Meta heuristics; Training set selection; Under-sampling; Classification (of information),Article

Many of those algorithms are implementations of quantum classifiers, or models for the classification of data inputs with a quantum computer. Following the success of collective decision making with ensembles in classical machine learning, this paper introduces the concept of quantum ensembles of quantum classifiers. Creating the ensemble corresponds to a state preparation routine, after which the quantum classifiers are evaluated in parallel and their combined decision is accessed by a single-qubit measurement. This framework naturally allows for exponentially large ensembles in which – similar to Bayesian learning – the individual classifiers do not have to be trained. As an example, we analyse an exponentially large quantum ensemble in which each classifier is weighed according to its performance in classifying the training data, leading to new results for quantum as well as classical machine learning. © 2018, The Author(s).",,,Article

Considering the non-deterministic polynomial-time hard characteristic of feature selection, meta-heuristics are introduced into feature selection in biomedicine on account of their excellent global search ability. However, most of biomedical problems are characterized by high dimensionality, which is a challenge for feature selection methods based on meta-heuristics due to the curse of dimensionality. Thus, six meta-heuristics, that is, a genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization, harmony search, differential evolution, and quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm, which are widely studied in the meta-heuristic community, are introduced into feature selection in this paper and the performance of the algorithms is analysed and compared with each other for solving feature selection in biomedicine effectively. To evaluate the search ability of the algorithms fairly and exactly, a set of feature selection benchmark problems are designed and yielded for the performance tests. The experimental results show that all the meta-heuristics are powerful enough to achieve the ideal results on low-dimensional feature selection problems, while it is essential to choose a proper algorithm for the high-dimensional ones. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.",biomedicine; feature selection; meta-heuristic,,Article

Several research works have demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms but the state-of-the-art algorithms are based on the classical theories of probability and logic. Quantum Mechanics (QM) has already shown its effectiveness in many fields and researchers have proposed several interesting results which cannot be obtained through classical theory. In recent years, researchers have been trying to investigate whether the QM can help to improve the classical machine learning algorithms. It is believed that the theory of QM may also inspire an effective algorithm if it is implemented properly. From this inspiration, we propose the quantum-inspired binary classifier, which is based on quantum detection theory. We used text corpora and image corpora to explore the effect of our proposed model. Our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure for several topics (categories) in the 20 newsgroup text corpora. Our proposed model outperformed all the baselines in terms of recall when the MNIST handwritten image dataset was used; F-measure is also higher for most of the categories and precision is also higher for some categories.

However, in order to find a potentially optimal feature subset for the feature selection problem, it is necessary to design an efficient exploration approach that can explore an enormous number of possible feature subsets. It is also necessary to use a powerful evaluation approach to assess the relevance of these feature subsets. This paper presents a new cooperative swarm intelligence algorithm for feature selection based on quantum computation and a combination of Firefly Algorithm (FA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Quantum computation ensures a good trade-off between the exploration and the exploitation of the search space while the combination of the FA and PSO enables an effective exploration of all the possible feature subsets. We use rough set theory to assess the relevance of the potential generated feature subsets. We tested the proposed algorithm on eleven UCI datasets and compared with a deterministic rough set reduction algorithms and other swarm intelligence algorithms. The experiment results show clearly that our algorithm provides a better rate of feature reduction and a high accuracy classification. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Classification; Feature selection; Quantum computation; Rough sets; Swarm intelligence,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Economic and social effects; Feature extraction; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Quantum computers; Set theory; Swarm intelligence; Classification process; Evaluation approach; Feature reduction; Feature selection problem; Firefly algorithms; Pre-processing step; Rough set reduction; Swarm intelligence algorithms; Rough set theory,Article

In this regard, we presented our first results in two previous works. First, a quantum counterpart of the NMC for two-dimensional problems was introduced, named Quantum Nearest Mean Classifier (QNMC), together with a possible generalization to any number of dimensions. Secondly, we studied the n-dimensional problem into detail and we showed a new encoding for arbitrary n-feature vectors into density operators. In the present paper, another promising encoding is considered, suggested by recent debates on quantum machine learning. Further, we observe a significant property concerning the non-invariance by feature rescaling of our quantum classifier. This fact, which represents a meaningful difference between the NMC and the respective quantum version, allows us to introduce a free parameter whose variation provides, in some cases, better classification results for the QNMC. The experimental section is devoted: (i) to compare the NMC and QNMC performance on different datasets; and (ii) to study the effects of the non-invariance under uniform rescaling for the QNMC. © 2017 by the authors.",Minimum distance classification; Quantum formalism applications; Rescaling parameter,,Article

At present, most of the studies are based on the assumed flattened SOC. This does not meet the needs of practice SOC, because most actual SOCs are of the structure of layers due to the universal use of the reuse technique. On the basis of IEEE P1500 ring based TAM and test bus based CTW this paper researches on multilevel TAM structures of hierarchical SOC. That two obedience certification of IEEE P1500 and two design processes of hierarchical SOC makes that IP core form providers can be provided in different ways to the SOC integrators. On the basis of the four layer model of SOC test architecture optimization, hierarchical SOC test architecture optimization model is presented according to classifications. This paper adopts black box idea to fuzzy hierarchical sub-core and single-core PW problems, and puts the flattened SOC test architecture optimization and hierarchical SOC test architecture optimization together in a same test framework. From a macroscopical view, this test framework ignores the structure changing inside of the black box, simplifies the multilevel TAM optimization and has a good scalability to various IP Core; from a microscopical view, finely deals with the different IP sub-core in the black box, and extends downwards by levels, so that achieves the goal of multilevel TAM optimization finally. Based on the test architecture research of hierarchical SOC, the paper applies quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm to SOC test architecture optimization, and establishes a heuristic process based on a property assumption of searching arithmetic to solve the PPAW. Through the observation of group, QEA can decide the allocation of IP core on TAM and the best individual of the current group, and gradually find the overall best individual by using the updated operation. The heuristic process significantly saves the time of CPU computing. The paper has partial hierarchical SOC in ITC'02 Test Benchmark as experimentation objects to make the simulation experiments.

Therefore, it is important to control the number of generations of QENN. The analysis on the convergence property of quantum bit evolution can contribute to designing a safe termination criterion that can always be reached. This paper proposes an appropriate termination criterion based on the average convergence rate (ACR). Experiments on classification tasks are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

The proposed Q-DNN uses stacked auto-encoder to form a deep neural network. This quantum computing concept has been used to optimize the learning parameters of the algorithm. To form a deep neural network, the selection of learning algorithms and its parameters is an important criterion for achieving better performance. However, learning capability depends upon the proper selection of learning parameters; improper selection may cause local minima or local maxima problem. To avoid improper selection of learning algorithm parameters, the quantum computing concept has been used, which is characterized by the representation of population dynamic, and evaluation function. It uses qubit for probabilistic representation which gives a large subspace for exploration to find an optimal value of the learning parameters. This concept has been utilized in the formation of stacked auto-encoder-based deep neural network by optimizing learning parameters of the learning algorithm. The proposed Q-DNN is trained and tested on various benchmark datasets such as the BUPA Liver Disorder, Ionosphere, PIMA Indians Diabetes, and the MNIST dataset on three different neural network architectures.

From an initial multitude of 17 features describing the geometry, colour, and texture of the CS images, the QPSO stage of our proposed technique is used to select the best subset features (i.e., global best particles) that represent a pruned down collection of seven features. Using a dataset of almost 1000 images, performance evaluation of our proposed Q-Fuzzy approach assesses the impact of our feature selection on classification accuracy by way of three experimental scenarios that are compared alongside two other approaches: the All-features (i.e., classification without prior feature selection) and another hybrid technique combining the standard PSO algorithm with the Fuzzy k-NN technique (P-Fuzzy approach). In the first and second scenarios, we further divided the assessment criteria in terms of classification accuracy based on the choice of best features and those in terms of the different categories of the cervical cells. In the third scenario, we introduced new QH hybrid techniques, i.e., QPSO combined with other supervised learning methods, and compared the classification accuracy alongside our proposed Q-Fuzzy approach. Furthermore, we employed statistical approaches to establish qualitative agreement with regards to the feature selection in the experimental scenarios 1 and 3.

The QEA-LFID approach employs the quantum-inspired evolutionary mechanism for selecting samples from the majority classes to alleviate the imbalance problem. Furthermore, we proposed the sample quantum gene and a fitness function built on the prediction precision of the minority and majority classes as well as the classifiers. An extensive empirical investigation involving multiple real-world datasets is performed, and comparative results show that QEA-LFID has the faster convergence rate, the stronger global optimization ability and the shorter computing time as well as the perfect performance. © 2014 ISSN 1881-803X.",Classification; Evolutionary algorithm; Imbalanced data set; Quantum; Sample quantum gene,Artificial intelligence; Evolutionary algorithms; Genes; Global optimization; Learning algorithms; Data mining and knowledge discovery; Empirical investigation; Evolutionary mechanisms; Imbalanced Data-sets; Optimization ability; Prediction precision; Quantum; Quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm; Classification (of information),Article

Thus, plant operators have to identify an event based upon the evaluation of several distinct process variables, which might difficult operators' actions and decisions. Transient identification systems have been proposed in order to support the analysis with the aim of achieving successful or effective courses of action, as well as to reduce the time interval for a decision and corrective actions. This article presents a system for accident and transient identification in a pressurized water nuclear reactor whose optimization step of the classification algorithm is based upon the paradigm of the Quantum Computing. In this case, the optimization metaheuristic Quantum Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA) was implemented and works like a data mining tool. The system is able to identify anomalous events, without the use of an initiating event (reactor scram, for instance) as the start point of a time dependence related to postulated transients.

In recent years, artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms have demonstrated astonishing performance when compared to traditional generative and discriminative classification algorithms. However, due to the complexity of classical ANN architectures, ANNs are sometimes incapable of providing efficient solutions when addressing complex distribution problems. Motivated by the mathematical definition of a quantum bit (qubit), we propose a novel autonomous perceptron model (APM) that can solve the problem of the architecture complexity of traditional ANNs. APM is a nonlinear classification model that has a simple and fixed architecture inspired by the computational superposition power of the qubit. The proposed perceptron is able to construct the activation operators autonomously after a limited number of iterations. Several experiments using various datasets are conducted, where all the empirical results show the superiority of the proposed model as a classifier in terms of accuracy and computational time when it is compared with baseline classification models. © 2019 by the authors.",Artificial neural networks; Machine learning; Pattern classification; Quantum-inspired neural network; Soft computing,,Article

It is well known that these algorithms when executed on a classical computer do not scale well with the size of the feature space both in terms of data points and dimensionality. One of the most significant limitations of classical algorithms using non-linear kernels is that the kernel function has to be evaluated for all pairs of input feature vectors which themselves may be of substantially high dimension. This can lead to computationally excessive times during training and during the prediction process for a new data point. Here, we propose using both canonical and generalized coherent states to calculate specific nonlinear kernel functions. The key link will be the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) property for SVMs that naturally arise from canonical and generalized coherent states. Specifically, we discuss the evaluation of radial kernels through a positive operator valued measure (POVM) on a quantum optical system based on canonical coherent states. A similar procedure may also lead to calculations of kernels not usually used in classical algorithms such as those arising from generalized coherent states. © Rinton Press.",Generalized coherent states; Quantum machine learning; Reproducing kernel hilbert spaces,Hilbert spaces; Learning systems; Optical systems; Quantum theory; Vector spaces; Coherent state; Machine learning classification; Nonlinear kernel functions; Positive-operator-valued measures; Quantum machines; Quantum optical systems; Reproducing kernel; Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces; Support vector machines,Article

Over the past few years, the field has been transformed by machine learning and stands to benefit from potential advances in quantum computing. The main challenge for processing images on current and near-term quantum devices is the size of the data such devices can process. Images can be large, multidimensional and have multiple color channels. Current machine learning approaches to computer vision that exploit quantum resources require a significant amount of manual pre-processing of the images in order to be able to fit them onto the device. This paper proposes a framework to address the problem of processing large scale data on small quantum devices. This framework does not require any dataset-specific processing or information and works on large, grayscale and RGB images. Furthermore, it is capable of scaling to larger quantum hardware architectures as they become available. In the proposed approach, a classical autoencoder is trained to compress the image data to a size that can be loaded onto a quantum device. Then, a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is trained on the D-Wave device using the compressed data, and the weights from the RBM are then used to initialize a neural network for image classification. Results are demonstrated on two MNIST datasets and two medical imaging datasets. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.",machine learning; medical imaging; Quantum computing; quantum machine learning,Computer vision; Data handling; Large dataset; Learning systems; Machine learning; Medical imaging; Medical robotics; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Signal encoding; Compressed datum; Hardware architecture; Large scale data; Machine learning approaches; Quantum Computing; Quantum machines; Quantum resources; Restricted boltzmann machine; Image classification,Article

A novel and generic framework based on quantum mechanics for image processing is proposed in this paper. The basic idea is to map each image element to a quantum system. This enables the utilization of the quantum mechanics powerful theory in solving image processing problems. The initial states of the image elements are evolved to the final states, controlled by an external force derived from the image features. The final states can be designed to correspond to the class of the element providing solutions to image segmentation, object recognition, and image classification problems. In this work, the formulation of the framework for a single-object segmentation problem is developed. The proposed algorithm based on this framework consists of four major steps. The first step is designing and estimating the operator that controls the evolution process from image features. The states associated with the pixels of the image are initialized in the second step. In the third step, the system is evolved. Finally, a measurement is performed to determine the output. The presented algorithm is tested on noiseless and noisy synthetic images as well as natural images. The average of the obtained results is 98.5 % for sensitivity and 99.7 % for specificity. A comparison with other segmentation algorithms is performed showing the superior performance of the proposed method. The application of the introduced quantum-based framework to image segmentation demonstrates high efficiency in handling different types of images. Moreover, it can be extended to multi-object segmentation and utilized in other applications in the fields of signal and image processing. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Image processing; Image segmentation; Quantum-inspired algorithms; Signal processing,Algorithms; Image classification; Image processing; Mechanics; Object recognition; Problem solving; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Signal processing; Evolution process; Generic frameworks; Image processing problems; Microscopic system; Multi-object segmentation; Segmentation algorithms; Signal and image processing; Synthetic images; Image segmentation,Article

Quantum-inspired evolutionary neural network (QENN) is a kind of evolving neural networks. Similar to other evolutionary algorithms, it is important to control the iteration of QENN, otherwise it will waste a lot of time when QENN has been convergent. This paper proposes an appropriate termination criterion to control the iteration of QENN. The proposed termination criterion is based on the probability of the best solution. Experiments about pattern classification on iris have been done to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the termination criterion. The results show that the termination criterion proposed in this paper could control the iteration of QENN effectively and save a mass of computing time by decreasing the number of generations of QENN. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",convergence; Q-bit representation; quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QEA); quantum-inspired evolutionary neural network (QENN); termination criterion,Evolutionary algorithms; Neural networks; convergence; Evolutionary neural network; Q-bit representation; Quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm; Termination criteria; Iterative methods,Conference paper

Apparently, the two aspects are contradicted in most realistic applications. Because of the dispersive multipath propagation in underwater acoustic channels, traditional coherent and adaptive receivers are computationally intensive and, hence, inapplicable to the large-scale underwater sensor networks. Inspired by quantum computing and nature intelligence that are incorporated with the concept of culture evolution, in this paper, we suggest a novel quantum memetic algorithm (QMA) built with more qualified problem-solving ability. Instead of classical gene representations, the quantum bit structure is employed by chromosomes to enhance the population diversity of genetic searching. The quantum gate rotating is then explored to update chromosomes in an efficiently parallel way. As a hybridization strategy, quantum-rotation-based local search is integrated in the lifetime learning to further refine individuals performance and accelerate their convergence toward the global optimality. As a significant real-world application, we develop a noncoherent underwater signal receiver that is based on a QMA framework. From a pattern recognition aspect, the suggested detection scheme includes two sequential phases: Features extraction and pattern classification. Finally, the highly computational optimization problem is elegantly addressed by QMA. Providing favorable robustness to various parameter configurations, QMA can considerably reinforce the search performance and improve the underwater signal detection. It is demonstrated from numerical experiments that QMA is much superior to genetic algorithm (GA) in this high-dimensional optimization. Meanwhile, QMA shows remarkable advantages in search performance, even to the current state-of-the-art quantum-inspired GA and memetic algorithm. © 1998-2012 IEEE.",High-dimensional optimization; hybridization evolution; noncoherent detection; quantum-inspired memetic algorithm; underwater acoustic communications,Communication channels (information theory); Genes; Optimization; Pattern recognition; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Sensor networks; Signal detection; Underwater acoustics; High-dimensional optimization; hybridization evolution; Memetic algorithms; Noncoherent detection; Underwater acoustic communications; Genetic algorithms,Article

Here we propose a DSQML protocol that the client can classify two-dimensional vectors to different clusters, resorting to a remote small-scale photon quantum computation processor.

An important question remaining is whether emerging quantum technologies will help or hinder the security of machine learning. Here we discuss a number of ways that quantum information can be used to help make quantum classifiers more secure or private. In particular, we demonstrate a form of robust principal component analysis that, under some circumstances, can provide an exponential speedup relative to robust methods used at present. To demonstrate this approach we introduce a linear combinations of unitaries Hamiltonian simulation method that we show functions when given an imprecise Hamiltonian oracle, which may be of independent interest. We also introduce a new quantum approach for bagging and boosting that can use quantum superposition over the classifiers or splits of the training set to aggragate over many more models than would be possible classically. Finally, we provide a private form of k-means clustering that can be used to prevent an all powerful adversary from learning more than a small fraction of a bit from any user. These examples show the role that quantum technologies can play in the security of ML and vice versa. This illustrates that quantum computing can provide useful advantages to machine learning apart from speedups. © 2018 The Author(s).

Recent years, as an innovative type of machine learning algorithms, quantum machine learning plays high parallel performance based on quantum mechanics. Consequently, it speeds up some of conventional algorithms. Researchers in quantum machine learning focus on improving performance of classical machine learning through quantum computation and exploring the possibility of combination of machine learning with quantum mechanics, and presenting some new algorithms. The framework of quantum machine learning mainly contains three steps: (1) Load and input classical data. It is converting classical information into quantum information. Making full use of high performance of quantum computation, it is necessary to encode classical data to quantum data according to quantum representation. (2) Construct series of unitary operators and use them to process quantum data. The basic principle of quantum computation is that all the operations must follow the unitary characteristics. Thereby, it is not possible to revise all classical algorithms to quantum environment, and not all the quantum algorithms can provide exponential speed-up. (3) Read and output the learning result. After the first two steps, the quantum machine learning results are quantum states. In order to read and output the useful learning result, it needs some necessary measurements to extract relevant information. There are three kinds of research in this field: (1) Use quantum computing accelerates the costly part of traditional algorithm. This work is the hybrid of classical algorithm and quantum parts. There is no change of the main idea of learning algorithm. But complex parts are running on quantum devices, and it makes full use of quantum computing to speed up counterparts. (2) Borrow the physics concept to propose new algorithms. It is based on the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics. And researchers develop more efficient methods to solve optimization problem. (3) Use machine learning methods to solve some physics issues, such as quantum tomography by using compress sensing. With the power of machine learning, researchers can explore quantum world from another perspective, vice versa. Quantum machine learning solves classical data mining and data analysis problems from another perspective. There are some difficulties in building general quantum computer, researchers still make solid progress. With the development of quantum techniques, practical quantum machine learning algorithms will increasingly be presented. Therefore, some typical algorithms of quantum machine learning are surveyed in this paper. Firstly, it introduces the fundamental concepts of quantum computation and classical machine learning, including quantum states, quantum gate, and measurement. Secondly, it summarizes the quantum machine learning algorithms from four aspects including quantum unsupervised clustering algorithm, quantum supervised classification algorithm, quantum dimension reduction algorithm, quantum deep learning. It collects some typical algorithms for every part. Meanwhile, it analyzes and makes a comparison of computational complexity between classical machine learning and quantum machine learning.

This procedure reduces the dimensionality of the dataset (avoiding the dimensionality curse) and improves the classification accuracy of the system. One of the most successful models applied for this task is the use of an Evolutionary Algorithm in a wrapper approach. These models produce excellent results but present the drawback of a considerable high processing time, a critical limitation for its application on real Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) systems. Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithms can be an alternative wrapper approach for the feature selection task, given that they outperform classical Evolutionary Algorithms in the exploration and exploitation of the search space, obtaining the global solution much faster. These algorithm employs concepts and principles from the Quantum Mechanics to probabilistically describe a set of different states between the classical logic states 0 and 1.

The performance analysis of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it with some well-known variants of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ABC algorithms, including standard binary PSO, new velocity based binary PSO, quantum inspired binary PSO, discrete ABC, modification rate based ABC, angle modulated ABC, and genetic algorithms on 10 benchmark datasets. The results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain higher classification performance in both training and test sets, and can eliminate irrelevant and redundant features more effectively than the other approaches. Note that all the algorithms used in this paper except for standard binary PSO and GA are employed for the first time in feature selection. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As linear classifiers, they play an important role in the foundations of machine learning. In the context of the emerging field of quantum machine learning, several attempts have been made to develop a corresponding unit using quantum information theory. Based on the quantum phase estimation algorithm, this paper introduces a quantum perceptron model imitating the step-activation function of a classical perceptron. This scheme requires resources in O(n) (where n is the size of the input) and promises efficient applications for more complex structures such as trainable quantum neural networks. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

For example, existing approaches in word embeddings will assign high probabilities to the words”Penguin” and”Fly” if they frequently co-occur, but it fails to capture the fact that they occur in an opposite sense - Penguins do not fly. We hypothesize that humans do not associate a single polarity or sentiment to each word. The word contributes to the overall polarity of a combination of words depending upon which other words it is combined with. This is analogous to the behavior of microscopic particles which exist in all possible states at the same time and interfere with each other to give rise to new states depending upon their relative phases. We make use of the Hilbert Space representation of such particles in Quantum Mechanics where we subscribe a relative phase to each word, which is a complex number, and investigate two such quantum inspired models to derive the meaning of a combination of words.

This ability has originated the quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEAs), which are classical algorithms (for classical computers) that exploit quantum mechanics principles to improve their performance. Several proposed QIEAs are able to outperform their traditional counterparts when applied to different kinds of problems. Aiming to exploit this new paradigm on genetic programming (GP), this paper introduces a novel QIEA model (quantum-inspired linear GP-QuaLiGP), which evolves machine code programs. QuaLiGP is inspired on multi-level quantum systems, and its operation is based on quantum individuals, which represent a superposition of all programs (solutions) of the search space. The tests use symbolic regression and binary classification as knowledge management problems to assess the QuaLiGP performance and compare it with Automatic Induction of Machine Code by Genetic Programming model, which is currently the most efficient GP model to evolve machine code. Results show that QuaLiGP outperforms the reference GP system for all these problems, by achieving better solutions from a smaller number of evaluations and by using fewer parameters and operators. This paper concludes that the quantum-inspired paradigm can be a competitive approach to evolve programs efficiently, encouraging improvements and extensions of QuaLiGP. © 2013 The Author.",binary classification; evolutionary computation; genetic programming; quantum-inspired algorithms; symbolic regression,Evolutionary algorithms; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Automatic induction; Binary classification; Genetic programming modeling; Knowledge management system; Linear genetic programming; Machine code programs; Quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm; Symbolic regression; Genetic programming,Article

For the singleobjective scheduling problems, a hybrid quantum-inspired genetic algorithm (HQGA) is developed to achieve more satisfactory performance. In the HQGA, a quantum-inspired GA (QGA) based on Q-bit representation is applied for exploration in discrete 0-1 hyperspace by using updating operator of quantum gate as well as genetic operators of Q-bit. And the random key representation is used to convert the Q-bit representation to job permutation for evaluating the objective value of the schedule solution. Moreover, a permutation-based GA (PGA) is applied for both performing exploration in permutation-based scheduling space and stressing exploitation for good schedule solutions. The HQGA can be viewed as a fusion of micro-space based search (Q-bit based search) and macro-space based search (permutation-based search). For the multi-objective scheduling problems, some special strategies are utilized on the basis of the HQGA for single-objective scheduling. In particular, the randomly weighted linear sum function is used in the QGA to evaluate solutions in multi-objective sense, and a non-dominated sorting technique including classification of Pareto front and fitness assignment is applied in the PGA regarding to both proximity and diversity. In addition, two trimming techniques for population are proposed and applied in the HQGA to maintain diversity of population. Simulations are carried out based on several single-objective and multi-objective benchmarks with some performance metrics. The results and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid quantuminspired genetic algorithms. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,Article
