Therefore, it is imperative to develop approaches for detecting Android malware. Recently developed malware detection methods usually rely on various features, such as application programming interface (API) sequences, images, and permissions, thereby ignoring the importance of source code and the associated comments, which are not usually included in malware. Therefore, we propose Android-SEM, which is an Android source code semantic enhancement model based on transfer learning. Our proposed model is built upon the Transformer architecture to achieve a pretraining framework for generating code comments from malware source code. The performance of the pretraining framework is optimized using a generative adversarial network. Our proposed model relies on a novel regression model-based filter to retain high-quality comments and source code for feature fusion pertinent to semantic enhancement. Creatively, and contrary to conventional methods, we incorporated a quantum support vector machine (QSVM) for classifying malicious Android code by combining quantum machine learning and classical deep learning models. The results proved that Android-SEM achieves accuracy levels of 99.55% and 99.01% for malware detection and malware categorization, respectively. © 2022 by the authors.

Similarly, as in other research communities, also in remote sensing (RS), it is not yet defined how its applications can benefit from the usage of quantum computing (QC). This letter proposes a formulation of the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm that can be executed by D-Wave quantum computers. Specifically, the SVR is mapped to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem that is solved with quantum annealing (QA). The algorithm is tested on two different types of computing environments offered by D-Wave: the advantage system, which directly embeds the problem into the quantum processing unit (QPU), and a hybrid solver that employs both classical and QC resources. For the evaluation, we considered a biophysical variable estimation problem with RS data. The experimental results show that the proposed quantum SVR implementation can achieve comparable or, in some cases, better results than the classical implementation. This work is one of the first attempts to provide insight into how QA could be exploited and integrated in future RS workflows based on machine learning (ML) algorithms.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",Quantum annealing (QA); quantum computing (QC); quantum machine learning (QML); remote sensing (RS); support vector regression (SVR),Annealing; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Quantum computers; Remote sensing; Annealing; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Optimisations; Quantum annealing; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Remote-sensing; Support vector regressions; Support vectors machine; algorithm; estimation method; machine learning; optimization; remote sensing; satellite data; support vector machine; Support vector machines,,Article

Developing a framework to accurately model the nonlinear degradation process of LiBs, which is indeed a supervised learning problem, becomes an important research topic. This paper presents a classical-quantum hybrid machine learning approach to capture the LiB degradation model that assesses the loss of battery cell life from the operating profiles. Our work is motivated by recent advances in quantum computers as well as the similarity between neural networks and quantum circuits. Similarly to adjusting weight parameters in conventional neural networks, the parameters of the quantum circuit, namely, the degree of freedom of the qubits, can be tuned to learn a nonlinear function in a supervised learning fashion. As a proof of concept paper, our obtained numerical results with the battery dataset provided by NASA demonstrate the ability of the quantum neural networks in modeling the nonlinear relationship between the degraded capacity and the operating cycles. We also discuss the potential advantage of the quantum approach compared to conventional neural networks in classical computers in dealing with massive data, especially in the context of future penetration of EVs and energy storage.  © 2023 IEEE.",battery degradation; battery life estimation; Lithium-ion battery; Quantum neural network,Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Digital storage; Electric discharges; Ions; Learning systems; NASA; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Battery capacity; Battery degradation; Battery life estimation; Capacity degradation; Discharge rates; High-power-density; Neural-networks; Quantum circuit; Quantum neural networks; Rechargeable lithium ion battery; Lithium-ion batteries,"15th Annual IEEE Green Technologies Conference, GreenTech 2023",Conference paper

To address this issue, a highly accurate technique for forecasting wind speed must be developed. In this work, a hybrid classical-quantum model is developed to exploit the advantages of two powerful models, a long short-term memory (LSTM) and a quantum neural network. Quantum neural networks, also known as parameterized quantum circuits, act like machine learning models but with greater expressive power. They comprise quantum gates that apply the principles of quantum mechanics in order to achieve quantum advantage. Additionally, to obtain a robust design that is insensitive to seasonal changes in the data, the Taguchi method is used to set up orthogonal experiments to set the hyperparameters of the proposed model. Historical data from seven sites in various countries (Taiwan, the Philippines, China, and South Korea) are used to forecast 24-hour-ahead wind speeds at the Fuhai wind farm near Taiwan.

With Moore’s law nearing its inevitable end and an ever-increasing demand for large-scale data analysis using machine learning, we must leverage non-conventional computing paradigms like quantum computing to train machine learning models efficiently. Adiabatic quantum computers can approximately solve NP-hard problems, such as the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), faster than classical computers. Since many machine learning problems are also NP-hard, we believe adiabatic quantum computers might be instrumental in training machine learning models efficiently in the post Moore’s law era. In order to solve problems on adiabatic quantum computers, they must be formulated as QUBO problems, which is very challenging. In this paper, we formulate the training problems of three machine learning models—linear regression, support vector machine (SVM) and balanced k-means clustering—as QUBO problems, making them conducive to be trained on adiabatic quantum computers. We also analyze the computational complexities of our formulations and compare them to corresponding state-of-the-art classical approaches. We show that the time and space complexities of our formulations are better (in case of SVM and balanced k-means clustering) or equivalent (in case of linear regression) to their classical counterparts. © 2021, The Author(s).",,,,Article

It is a powerful formalism to represent both the quantum and classical uncertainty of quantum systems and to express different statistical operations such as measurement, system combination and expectations as linear algebra operations. This paper explores how density matrices can be used as a building block for machine learning models exploiting their ability to straightforwardly combine linear algebra and probability. One of the main results of the paper is to show that density matrices coupled with random Fourier features could approximate arbitrary probability distributions over Rn. Based on this finding the paper builds different models for density estimation, classification and regression. These models are differentiable, so it is possible to integrate them with other differentiable components, such as deep learning architectures and to learn their parameters using gradient-based optimization. In addition, the paper presents optimization-less training strategies based on estimation and model averaging. The models are evaluated in benchmark tasks and the results are reported and discussed. © 2022, The Author(s).",Classification; Density estimation; Density matrix; Quantum machine learning; Regression,Deep learning; Learning systems; Probability distributions; Quantum optics; Uncertainty analysis; Density estimation; Density matrix; Machine-learning; Measurement system; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum system; Random features; Regression; Uncertainty; Matrix algebra,,Article

With the proposed framework, the target function is approximated by a mixture of experts model on a low-dimensional manifold, where each cluster is associated with a fixed-degree polynomial. We present a training strategy that leverages the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. During the training, we alternate between (i) applying gradient descent to update the DNN coefficients; and (ii) using closed-form formulae derived from the EM algorithm to update the mixture of experts model parameters. Under the probabilistic formulation, step (ii) admits the form of embarrassingly paralleliazable weighted least-squares solves. The PPOU-Nets consistently outperform the baseline fully-connected neural networks of comparable sizes in numerical experiments of various data dimensions.

Computational methods coupled with global optimization algorithms have been used successfully for this purpose. In this work, we have developed an artificial intelligence method based on active learning (AL) or Bayesian optimization for the automatic structural elucidation of vacancies in solids and nanoparticles. AL uses machine learning regression algorithms and their uncertainties to take decisions (from a policy) on the next unexplored structures to be computed, increasing the probability of finding the global minimum with few calculations. The methodology allows an accurate and automated structural elucidation for vacancies, which are common in non-stoichiometric (berthollide) materials, helping to understand chemical processes in catalysis and environmental sciences, for instance. The AL vacancies method was implemented in the quantum machine learning software/agent for material design and discovery (QMLMaterial). Also, two additional acquisition functions for decision making were implemented, besides the expected improvement (EI): the lower confidence bound (LCB) and the probability of improvement (PI). The new software was applied for the automatic structural search for graphite (C36) with 3 (C36-3) and 4 (C36-4) carbon vacancies and C60 (C60-4) fullerene with 4 carbon vacancies. DFTB calculations were used to build the complex search surfaces with reasonably low computational cost. Furthermore, with the AL method for vacancies, it was possible to elucidate the optimum oxygen vacancy distribution in CaTiO3 perovskite by DFT, where a semiconductor behavior results from oxygen vacancies. Throughout the work, a Gaussian process with its uncertainty was employed in the AL framework using different acquisition functions (EI, LCB and PI), and taking into account different descriptors: Ewald sum matrix and sine matrix. Finally, the performance of the proposed AL method was compared to random search and genetic algorithm. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Carbon; Decision making; Design for testability; Genetic algorithms; Global optimization; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Oxygen vacancies; Perovskite; Structural optimization; Active Learning; Active learning methods; C 60; Carbon vacancy; Expected improvements; Lower confidence bound; matrix; Nonstoichiometric; Structural elucidation; Uncertainty; Nanoparticles,,Article

While decoherence of qubits is expected to decrease the performance of QML models, it is unclear to what extent the diminished performance can be compensated for by adding ancillas to the models and accordingly increasing the virtual bond dimension of the models. We investigate here the competition between decoherence and adding ancillas on the classification performance of two models, with an analysis of the decoherence effect from the perspective of regression. We present numerical evidence that the fully decohered unitary tree tensor network (TTN) with two ancillas performs at least as well as the non-decohered unitary TTN, suggesting that it is beneficial to add at least two ancillas to the unitary TTN regardless of the amount of decoherence may be consequently introduced. © 2023, The Author(s).",Decoherence; Quantum machine learning; Tensor networks,Machine learning; Quantum theory; Qubits; Classification performance; Decoherence; Decoherence effects; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Performance; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Tensor network; Virtual bonds; Tensors,,Article

These transforms appear in many problems related to classification/clustering, regression, system identification, system inversion, and input signal restoration/separation. We here analyze the connections between all these problems in the classical and quantum frameworks. We then focus on their most challenging versions, involving quantum data and/or quantum processing means, and unsupervised, i.e., blind, learning. We consider the general single-preparation quantum information processing (SIPQIP) framework that we have recently proposed. It involves methods that can work with a single instance of each (unknown) state, whereas usual methods are quite cumbersome because they have to very accurately create many copies of each (known) state. In our previous papers, we applied the SIPQIP approach to only one task [blind quantum process tomography (BQPT)], but it opens the way to a large range of other types of methods. In this article, we, therefore, propose various new SIPQIP methods that efficiently perform tasks related to system identification (blind Hamiltonian parameter estimation (BHPE), blind quantum channel identification/estimation, and blind phase estimation), system inversion and state estimation (blind quantum source separation (BQSS), blind quantum entangled state restoration (BQSR), and blind quantum channel equalization), and classification. Numerical tests show that our SIPQIP framework, moreover, yields much more accurate estimation than the usual multiple-preparation approach. Our methods are especially useful in a quantum computer, which we propose to more briefly call a 'quamputer': BQPT and BHPE simplify the characterization of quamputer gates; BQSS and BQSR yield quantum gates that may be used to compensate for the nonidealities that alter states stored in quantum registers and open the way to very general self-adaptive quantum gates. © 2020 IEEE.",Blind Hamiltonian parameter estimation (BHPE); blind quantum process tomography (BQPT); blind quantum source separation (BQSS); blind quantum state restoration (BQSR); blind/unsupervised quantum machine learning; Heisenberg exchange coupling; quantum classification; quantum computer (quamputer); single-preparation quantum information processing (SIPQIP); spin-based qubits,Blind equalization; Blind source separation; Classification (of information); Hamiltonians; Machine learning; Parameter estimation; Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Religious buildings; Restoration; Signal reconstruction; Tomography; Blind hamiltonian parameter estimation; Blind quantum process tomography; Blind quantum source separation; Blind quantum source separations; Blind quantum state restoration; Blind/unsupervised quantum machine learning; Hamiltonian parameters; Heisenberg exchange; Heisenberg exchange coupling; Parameters estimation; Quanta computers; Quantum classification; Quantum computer; Quantum information processing; Quantum process tomography; Quantum state; Single-preparation quantum information processing; Spin-based qubit; State restoration; Quantum optics,,Article

It can be used for supervised learning when combined with classical gradient-based optimizers. Despite the existing empirical and theoretical investigations, the convergence of QNN training is not fully understood. Inspired by the success of the neural tangent kernels (NTKs) in probing into the dynamics of classical neural networks, a recent line of works proposes to study over-parameterized QNNs by examining a quantum version of tangent kernels. In this work, we study the dynamics of QNNs and show that contrary to popular belief it is qualitatively different from that of any kernel regression: due to the unitarity of quantum operations, there is a non-negligible deviation from the tangent kernel regression derived at the random initialization. As a result of the deviation, we prove the at-most sublinear convergence for QNNs with Pauli measurements, which is beyond the explanatory power of any kernel regression dynamics. We then present the actual dynamics of QNNs in the limit of over-parameterization. The new dynamics capture the change of convergence rate during training, and implies that the range of measurements is crucial to the fast QNN convergence. © 2023 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

However, due to limited qubits or hardware noise, conducting large-scale experiments often requires significant resources. Moreover, the output of the model is susceptible to corruption by quantum hardware noise. To address this issue, we propose the use of ensemble techniques, which involve constructing a single machine learning model based on multiple instances of quantum neural networks. In particular, we implement bagging and AdaBoost techniques, with different data loading configurations, and evaluate their performance on both synthetic and real-world classification and regression tasks. To assess the potential performance improvement under different environments, we conducted experiments on both simulated, noiseless software and IBM superconducting-based QPUs, suggesting these techniques can mitigate the quantum hardware noise. Additionally, we quantify the amount of resources saved using these ensemble techniques. Our findings indicate that these methods enable the construction of large, powerful models even on relatively small quantum devices. © 2023, The Author(s).",Bagging; Boosting; Ensemble technique; Quantum machine learning; Quantum neural network,Machine learning; Qubits; Bagging; Boosting; Current generation; Ensemble techniques; Machine-learning; Performance; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum neural networks; Resource savings; Adaptive boosting,,Article

Its security is derived from cryptographic hardness of learning decryption functions of public-key cryptosystems. Our design compactly realizes the decryption function of the learning-with-errors (LWE) cryptosystem. Due to the fundamental connection of LWE to lattice problems, we call the construction the lattice PUF. Lattice PUF is constructed using a physically obfuscated key (POK), an LWE decryption function block, and a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) as a pseudo-random number generator. The POK provides the secret key of the LWE decryption function; its stability is ensured by a fuzzy extractor (FE). To reduce the challenge size, we exploit distributional relaxations of space-efficient LWEs. That allows only a small challenge-seed to be transmitted with the full-length challenge generated by the LFSR, resulting in a 100X reduction of communication cost. To prevent an active challenge-manipulation attack, a self-incrementing counter is embedded into the challenge seed. We prototyped the lattice PUF with 2136 challenge-response pairs (CRPs) on a Spartan 6 FPGA, which required 45 slices for the PUF logic proper and 233 slices for the FE. Simulation-based evaluation shows the mean (std) of uniformity to be 49.98 % (1. 58%), of uniqueness to be 50.00 % (1. 58%), and of reliability to be 1. 26% (2. 88%). The LWE concrete hardness estimator guarantees that a successful ML attack of the lattice PUF will require the infeasible 2128 CPU operations.

Recent implementations include quantum dot arrays, where the ground state of a multi q-bit system can be altered by voltages applied to the top gates. An extensive investigation concerning the spectra of the many-electron systems under multiple operation conditions set by external voltages typically requires a relatively large number of Hamiltonian diagonalizations, where the Coulomb interaction is considered in an exact manner. Instead of making exhaustive calculations using high throughput computing, we approach this problem by augmenting numerical diagonalizations with machine learning techniques designed to predict the many-electron eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. To this end, we employ and compare the results from linear regression methods such as multivariate least squares (MLS) as well as non-linear techniques based on kernel ridge regression (KRR), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs).

In this paper, we present a quantum partial least squares (QPLS) regression algorithm. To solve the high time complexity of the PLS regression, we design a quantum eigenvector search method to speed up principal components and regression parameters construction. Meanwhile, we give a density matrix product method to avoid multiple access to quantum random access memory (QRAM) during building residual matrices. The time and space complexities of the QPLS regression are logarithmic in the independent variable dimension n, the dependent variable dimension w, and the number of variables m. This algorithm achieves exponential speed-ups over the PLS regression on n, m, and w. In addition, the QPLS regression inspires us to explore more potential quantum machine learning applications in future works. © 2022 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.",eigenvalue decomposition; partial least squares regression; quantum machine learning,Learning algorithms; Least squares approximations; Machine learning; Matrix algebra; Principal component analysis; Random access storage; Regression analysis; Eigen-value; Eigenvalue decomposition; Least-square regression algorithms; Linear regression methods; Multiple correlation; Multiple regressions; Partial least square regression; Principal-component analysis; Quantum machine learning; Variable-dimension; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions,,Article

This paper proposes the use of real superconducting quantum computing devices as the reservoir, where the dissipative property is served by the natural noise added to the quantum bits. The performance of this natural quantum reservoir is demonstrated in a benchmark time-series regression problem and a practical problem classifying different objects based on temporal sensor data. In both cases the proposed reservoir computer shows a higher performance than a linear regression or classification model.

Here, we present the matrix of orthogonalized atomic orbital coefficients (MAOC) as a quantum-inspired molecular and atomic representation containing both structural (composition and geometry) and electronic (charge and spin multiplicity) information. MAOC is based on a cost-effective localization scheme that represents localized orbitals via a predefined set of atomic orbitals. The latter can be constructed from such small atom-centered basis sets as pcseg-0 and STO-3G in conjunction with guess (non-optimized) electronic configuration of the molecule. Importantly, MAOC is suitable for representing monatomic, molecular, and periodic systems and can distinguish compounds with identical compositions and geometries but distinct charges and spin multiplicities. Using principal component analysis, we constructed a more compact but equally powerful version of MAOC—PCX-MAOC. To test the performance of full and reduced MAOC and several other representations (CM, SOAP, SLATM, and SPAHM), we used a kernel ridge regression machine learning model to predict frontier molecular orbital energy levels and ground state single-point energies for chemically diverse neutral and charged, closed- and open-shell molecules from an extended QM7b dataset, as well as two new datasets, N-HPC-1 (N-heteropolycycles) and REDOX (nitroxyl and phenoxyl radicals, carbonyl, and cyano compounds). MAOC affords accuracy that is either similar or superior to other representations for a range of chemical properties and systems. © 2023 Author(s).",,Atoms; Carbonyl compounds; Chemical bonds; Cost effectiveness; Ground state; Machine learning; Principal component analysis; Regression analysis; Atomic orbital; Coefficient representation; Electronic charges; Electronic spins; Machine-learning; matrix; Quantum machines; Spin multiplicity; Structural composition; Structural geometry; Molecules,,Article

Nonetheless, due to the lack of effective and efficient tools for handling high-dimensional and complex fMRI data, this potential has still not been fully explored. A critical issue to be addressed is to identify clinically relevant features from high dimensional fMRI data in a fast and accurate manner. To address this problem, a new quantum-behaved multiverse optimization (QMVO) approach is proposed for fMRI dimensionality reduction and a new prediction approach based on L1-norm sparse coding and adaptive dictionary learning (SCDL) is developed to decode the whole brain fMRI data. QMVO is designed to enhance local search ability, avoid premature convergence, and increase population diversity among individuals. Further, to efficiently re-estimate parameters of the prediction model with new available data, a new SCDL sparse coding is proposed, which requires no training and needs minimal parameters to tune. The proposed QMVO-SCDL model is applied to a pain-evoked fMRI dataset to decode the pain perception level. Results show that QMVO-SCDL can decode pain levels and identify predictive fMRI patterns with high accuracy, high convergence speed, and short consumption time. Moreover, the performance of the proposed model outperforms different recent ML techniques.

To unlock the potential benefits of QC, quantum software development (QSD) enables harnessing its power, further driving innovation across diverse domains. To ensure successful QSD projects, it is crucial to concentrate on key variables. Objective: This study aims to identify key variables in QSD and develop a model for predicting the success probability of QSD projects. Methodology: We identified key QSD variables from existing literature to achieve these objectives and collected expert insights using a survey instrument. We then analyzed these variables using an optimization model, i.e., Genetic Algorithm (GA), with two different prediction methods the Naïve Bayes Classifier (NBC) and Logistic Regression (LR). Results: The results of success probability prediction models indicate that as the QSD process matures, project success probability significantly increases, and costs are notably reduced. Furthermore, the best fitness rankings for each QSD project variable determined using NBC and LR indicated a strong positive correlation (rs=0.945). The t-test results (t = 0.851, p = 0.402>0.05) show no significant differences between the rankings calculated by the two methods (NBC and LR). Conclusion: The results reveal that the developed success probability prediction model, based on 14 identified QSD project variables, highlights the areas where practitioners need to focus more in order to facilitate the cost-effective and successful implementation of QSD projects. © 2023 The Author(s)",Genetic algorithm; Prediction model; Quantum computing (QC); Quantum software development (QSD); Variables,Barium compounds; Cost effectiveness; Forecasting; Genetic programming; Logistic regression; Quantum computers; Software design; Key variables; Logistics regressions; Model-based OPC; Naive Bayes classifiers; Prediction modelling; Quantum Computing; Quantum software development; Software development projects; Variable; Genetic algorithms,,Article

However, many types of noise impart bias into the created number, impairing its randomness. To compensate for the noise-induced bias and generate reliable random numbers, we propose gate parameter optimization of the TRNG circuit. We employ a hybrid quantum-classical loop to optimize the gate parameter. The parameter optimization routine can compensate for the bias and enhance the random number’s quality by utilizing even the lowest quality qubits. However, finding the ideal parameter involves lengthy repetitions between classical and quantum machines in the hybrid configuration. We conduct a series of error characterization and quantum tomography experiments to examine the effects of various noises such as gate error, decoherence, and readout error on QC-based true random number generators (TRNG)s. Leveraging insights from the study, we develop a regression-based machine learning approach that predicts the optimal gate parameter from qubit error specification without invoking the costly quantum-classical loop. Moreover, we propose another method by merging the hybrid loop and regression-based model to fine-tune the parameter. We validate our approaches by using experiments on real quantum computers from IBM and testing the generated bitstrings with the NIST statistical test suite. Experimental results suggest that the techniques can correct bias by up to 88.57%, even in worst-case qubits. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Decoherence; NISQ; Qiskit; Quantum computer; Quantum gate error; Quantum optimization; Quantum readout error; Quantum state tomography; Quantum true random number generator,,,Book chapter

First, a quantum classifier that can well balance the computational cost such as the number of measurements and the learning performance is unexplored. Second, it is unclear whether quantum classifiers can be applied to solve certain problems that outperform their classical counterparts. Here we devise a Grover-search based quantum learning scheme (GBLS) to address the above two issues. Notably, most existing QNN-based quantum classifiers can be seamlessly embedded into the proposed scheme. The key insight behind our proposal is reformulating the classification tasks as the search problem. Numerical simulations exhibit that GBLS can achieve comparable performance with other quantum classifiers under various noise settings, while the required number of measurements is dramatically reduced. We further demonstrate a potential quantum advantage of GBLS over classical classifiers in the measure of query complexity. Our work provides guidance to develop advanced quantum classifiers on near-term quantum devices and opens up an avenue to explore potential quantum advantages in various classification tasks. © 2021 The Author(s).

In this paper we propose a quantum few-shot embedding learning paradigm, which learns embeddings useful for training downstream quantum machine learning tasks. Crucially, we identify the circuit bypass problem in hybrid neural networks, where learned classical parameters are optimized to represent the dataset without the quantum kernel. We observe that the few-shot learning embeddings generalize to unseen classes, and suffer less from the circuit bypass problem in terms of better occupation of the parameter space compared with embeddings learned from regression and classification.  © 2022 IEEE.",few-shot learning; parameterized quantum circuits; Quantum machine learning,Computer vision; Machine learning; Timing circuits; Classical neural networks; Embeddings; Few-shot learning; Machine-learning; Parameterized; Parameterized quantum circuit; Quantum circuit; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum-classical; Embeddings,"3rd IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2022",Conference paper

An important requirement for networked quantum computation is therefore the ability to coherently convert the quantum information from microwave to optical frequencies and vice-versa. We theoretically address a scheme to achieve this via an intermediate conversion to magnons that enhances the weak direct magneto-optical coupling. We wish to demonstrate the feasibility of such a scheme by employing the magnetoelastic coupling between the modes of a magnetic vortex (vortex breathing mode, VBM) and that of the lattice (elastic breathing mode, EBM), which requires no additional external bias field. In our setup all but the opto-mechanical coupling can be made resonant. We propose an alternative Mumax3 simulation post-processing procedure for semi-classical normalization, where we use regression analysis of the the internal energy dependency on excitation amplitude in a limit cycle motion.

Traditional machine-learning models struggle with large-scale datasets and complex relationships. This research introduces a novel methodological framework for supply chain backorder prediction, addressing the challenge of collecting large real-world datasets with 90% accuracy. Our proposed model demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting backorders on short and imbalanced datasets. We capture intricate patterns and dependencies by leveraging quantum-inspired techniques within the quantum-classical neural network QAmplifyNet. Experimental evaluations on a benchmark dataset establish QAmplifyNet’s superiority over eight classical models, three classically stacked quantum ensembles, five quantum neural networks, and a deep reinforcement learning model. Its ability to handle short, imbalanced datasets makes it ideal for supply chain management. We evaluate seven preprocessing techniques, selecting the best one based on logistic regression’s performance on each preprocessed dataset. The model’s interpretability is enhanced using Explainable artificial intelligence techniques. Practical implications include improved inventory control, reduced backorders, and enhanced operational efficiency. QAmplifyNet also achieved the highest F1-score of 94% for predicting “Not Backorder” and 75% for predicting “backorder,” outperforming all other models. It also exhibited the highest AUC-ROC score of 79.85%, further validating its superior predictive capabilities. QAmplifyNet seamlessly integrates into real-world supply chain management systems, empowering proactive decision-making and efficient resource allocation. Future work involves exploring additional quantum-inspired techniques, expanding the dataset, and investigating other supply chain applications. This research unlocks the potential of quantum computing in supply chain optimization and paves the way for further exploration of quantum-inspired machine learning models in supply chain management.

The search for ideal QML models is an active research field. This includes identification of efficient classical-to-quantum data encoding scheme, construction of parametric quantum circuits (PQC) with optimal expressivity and entanglement capability, and efficient output decoding scheme to minimize the required number of measurements, to name a few. However, most of the empirical/numerical studies lack a clear path towards scalability. Any potential benefit observed in a simulated environment may diminish in practical applications due to the limitations of noisy quantum hardware (e.g., under decoherence, gate-errors, and crosstalk). We present a scalable quantum-classical hybrid deep neural network (DeepQMLP) architecture inspired by classical deep neural network architectures. In DeepQMLP, stacked shallow Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models mimic the hidden layers of a classical feed-forward multi-layer perceptron network. Each QNN layer produces a new and potentially rich representation of the input data for the next layer. This new representation can be tuned by the parameters of the circuit. Shallow QNN models experience less decoherence, gate errors, etc. which make them (and the network) more resilient to quantum noise. We present numerical studies on a variety of classification problems to show the trainability of DeepQMLP. We also show that DeepQMLP performs reasonably well on unseen data and exhibits greater resilience to noise over QNN models that use a deep quantum circuit.

Many works have examined the behavior of the fall of stock markets and have built models to predict them. Nevertheless, there are limitations to the available research, and the literature calls for more investigation on the topic, as currently the accuracy of the models remains low and they have only been extended for the largest economies. This study provides a comparison of quantum forecast methods and stock market declines and, therefore, a new prediction model of stock market crashes via real-time recession probabilities with the power to accurately estimate future global stock market downturn scenarios is achieved. A 104-country sample has been used, allowing the sample compositions to take into account the regional diversity of the alert warning indicators. To obtain a robust model, several alternative techniques have been employed on the sample under study, being Quantum Boltzmann Machines, which have obtained very good prediction results due to their ability to remember features and develop long-term dependencies from time series and sequential data.

However, higher dimensional quantum systems constitute a promising alternative and are increasingly explored in theory and practice. Here, we explore the capabilities of multi-level quantum systems, so-called qudits, for their use in a quantum machine learning context. We formulate classification and regression problems with the data re-uploading approach and demonstrate that a quantum circuit operating on a single qudit is able to successfully learn highly non-linear decision boundaries of classification problems such as the MNIST digit recognition problem. We demonstrate that the performance strongly depends on the relation between the qudit states representing the labels and the structure of labels in the training data set. Such a bias can lead to substantial performance improvement over qubit-based circuits in cases where the labels, the qudit states, and the operators employed to encode the data are well-aligned. Furthermore, we elucidate the influence of the choice of the elementary operators and show that a squeezing operator is necessary to achieve good performances. We also show that there exists a trade-off for qudit systems between the number of circuit-generating operators in each processing layer and the total number of layers needed to achieve a given accuracy. Finally, we compare classification results from numerically exact simulations and their equivalent implementation on actual IBM quantum hardware.

The primary focus of this domain is the implementation of classical machine learning algorithms in the quantum mechanical domain and study of the speedup due to quantum parallelism, which could enable the development of novel techniques for solving problems such as quantum phase recognition and quantum error correction optimization. In this paper, we propose a hybrid quantum machine learning pipeline for predicting the atomization energies of various molecules using the nuclear charges and atomic positions of the constituent atoms. Firstly, we will be using a deep convolutional auto-encoder model for the feature extraction of data constructed from the eigenvalues and eigenvector centralities of the pairwise distance matrix calculated from atomic positions and the unrolled upper triangle of each Coulomb matrix calculated from nuclear charges, and we will then be using a quantum regression algorithm such as quantum linear regression, quantum radial basis function neural network and, a quantum neural network for estimating the atomization energy. The hybrid quantum neural network models do not seem to provide any speedup over their classical counterparts. Before implementing a quantum algorithm, we will also be using state-of-the-art classical machine learning and deep learning models such as XGBoost, multilayer perceptron, deep convolutional neural network, and a long short-term memory network to study the correlation between the extracted features and corresponding atomization energies of molecules.  © 2021 The Author(s).",Atomization energies; Quantum machine learning; Quantum neural network; Quantum regression model,Atomization; Atoms; Clustering algorithms; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Error correction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Matrix algebra; Molecules; Multilayer neural networks; Quantum computers; Radial basis function networks; Regression analysis; Classical counterpart; Eigenvalues and eigenvector; High dimensional data; Molecular atomization energies; Quantum error corrections; Quantum neural networks; Radial basis function neural networks; Regression algorithms; Quantum theory,,Article

However, modeling these kinds of systems in silico, such as finding the optimum adsorption geometry and energy, is challenging, due to the huge number of possibilities of assembling the adsorbate on the surface. In the current work, we have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) approach based on an active learning (AL) method for adsorption optimization on the surface of materials. AL uses machine learning (ML) regression algorithms and their uncertainties to make a decision (based on a policy) for the next unexplored structures to be computed, increasing, though, the probability of finding the global minimum with a small number of calculations. The methodology allows an accurate and automated structural elucidation of the adsorbate on the surface, based on the minimization of the total electronic energy. The new AL method for adsorption optimization was developed and implemented in the quantum machine learning software/agent for material design and discovery (QMLMaterial) program and was applied for C60@TiO2 anatase (101). It marks another software extension with a new feature in addition to the automatic structural elucidation of defects in materials and of nanoparticles as well. SCC-DFTB calculations were used to build the complex search surfaces with a reasonably low computational cost.

One major direction is using quantum linear algebra to solve linear system problems or optimization problems in the machine learning area. Quantum approaches in the literature for different types of least squares problems demonstrate speedups w.r.t. dimension but have disadvantages w.r.t. precision and condition number. In this paper, we discuss how an iterative refinement scheme can deliver an accurate solution without the excessive cost of Quantum Linear System Algorithms (QLSAs). In addition, we propose an adaptive regularization approach that can mitigate the effect of condition number on solution time. In the second part of this paper, we investigate how state-of-the-art Quantum Interior Point Methods (QIPMs) can solve more sophisticated regression problems such as Lasso regression and support vector machine problems, which can be reformulated as quadratic optimization problems.  © 2022 IEEE.",Iterative Refinement; Lasso Regression; Least Squares Method; Quantum Interior Point Method; Quantum Linear System Algorithm; Quantum Machine Learning; Support Vector Machine,Iterative methods; Learning systems; Least squares approximations; Linear algebra; Linear programming; Linear systems; Number theory; Quadratic programming; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Regression analysis; Interior-point method; Iterative refinement; Lasso regressions; Least-squares- methods; Machine-learning; Quantum interior point method; Quantum linear system algorithm; Quantum linear systems; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Support vectors machine; System algorithm; Support vector machines,"7th IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing, SEC 2022",Conference paper

Data-driven approaches to error mitigation are promising, with popular examples including zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) and Clifford data regression (CDR). Here, we propose a scalable error mitigation method that conceptually unifies ZNE and CDR. Our approach, called variable-noise Clifford data regression (vnCDR), significantly outperforms these individual methods in numerical benchmarks. vnCDR generates training data first via near-Clifford circuits (which are classically simulable) and second by varying the noise levels in these circuits. We employ a noise model obtained from IBM's Ourense quantum computer to benchmark our method. For the problem of estimating the energy of an 8-qubit Ising model system, vnCDR improves the absolute energy error by a factor of 33 over the unmitigated results and by factors of 20 and 1.8 over ZNE and CDR, respectively. For the problem of correcting observables from random quantum circuits with 64 qubits, vnCDR improves the error by factors of 2.7 and 1.5 over ZNE and CDR, respectively. © 2021 Published by the American Physical Society",,Clock and data recovery circuits (CDR circuits); Ising model; Numerical methods; Qubits; Data regression; Data-driven approach; Error mitigation; Noise modeling; Numerical benchmark; Quantum circuit; Quantum error; Unified approach; Errors,,Article

Many industries, such as manufacturing and logistics, still depend heavily on manual labor. However, by integrating sensor technology and data processing, different processes can be appropriately tracked and streamlined. Comprehensive knowledge of the occurrence, duration, and properties of related human activities is needed to draw inferences on enhancing employee performance. The increased use of numerous wearable sensors to monitor human activities has resulted in an unexpected data explosion. The pace at which this data is being generated is expected to outpace conventional technology’s ability to handle it by 2030. At present, quantum computing is the most promising market solution.

We propose an intuitively appealing estimation method based on identifying the linearly independent columns in the coefficient matrix. Our method relaxes the low rank constraint in the existing literature and allows the rank to diverge with dimensions. The linearly independent columns are selected by a novel non-oracular quantum search (NQS) algorithm which is significantly faster than classical search methods implemented on electronic computers. Besides, NQS achieves a near optimal computational complexity as existing quantum search algorithms but does not require any oracle information of the solution state. We prove the proposed estimation procedure enjoys desirable theoretical properties.

In order to reduce the complexity of subspace learning, Cai et al. proposed a spectral regression dimensionality reduction framework, and proposed efficient spectral regression for subspace learning that constructed their graph by incorporating the label information. In recent years, the development of quantum computing has made it possible to further reduce the complexity of subspace learning algorithms. Meng et al. pioneered the quantum algorithm for spectral regression (MYXZ algorithm). In this article, the limitations of the MYXZ algorithm are pointed out. We point out that MYXZ algorithm uses sparse Hamiltonian simulation technology to process the matrix generated by the weight matrix, but this matrix is a dense matrix in some cases. In response to this situation, we propose an improved quantum spectral regression algorithm. Our improved algorithm uses quantum singular value estimation technology, which has a polynomial acceleration compared with MYXZ algorithm when dealing with dense matrices. In addition, we propose a new quantum algorithm to accelerate the classical efficient spectral regression. The problems that our new algorithm can handle cannot be handled by MYXZ algorithm.

In a high-dimensional space, such algorithms perform poorly due to the difficulty of acquisition function optimization. Herein, we apply Ising machines to overcome the difficulty in the continuous black-box optimization. As an Ising machine specializes in optimization of binary problems, a continuous vector has to be encoded to binary, and the solution by Ising machines has to be translated back. Our method has the following three parts: (1) random subspace coding based on axis-parallel hyperrectangles from continuous vector to binary vector, (2) a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) defined by the acquisition function based on the nonnegative-weighted linear regression model, which is solved by Ising machines, and (3) a penalization scheme to ensure that the solution can be translated back. It is shown with benchmark tests that its performance using the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer and simulated annealing is competitive with a state-of-the-art method based on the Gaussian process in high-dimensional problems.

In this work, we recognize that many state-of-the-art error mitigation methods share a common feature: they are data-driven, employing classical data obtained from runs of different quantum circuits. For example, Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) uses variable noise data and Clifford-data regression (CDR) uses data from near-Clifford circuits. We show that Virtual Distillation (VD) can be viewed in a similar manner by considering classical data produced from different numbers of state preparations. Observing this fact allows us to unify these three methods under a general data-driven error mitigation framework that we call UNIfied Technique for Error mitigation with Data (UNITED). In certain situations, we find that our UNITED method can outperform the individual methods (i.e., the whole is better than the individual parts). Specifically, we employ a realistic noise model obtained from a trapped ion quantum computer to benchmark UNITED, as well as other state-of-the-art methods, in mitigating observables produced from random quantum circuits and the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) applied to Max-Cut problems with various numbers of qubits, circuit depths and total numbers of shots. We find that the performance of different techniques depends strongly on shot budgets, with more powerful methods requiring more shots for optimal performance. For our largest considered shot budget (1010), we find that UNITED gives the most accurate mitigation. Hence, our work represents a benchmarking of current error mitigation methods and provides a guide for the regimes when certain methods are most useful. © 2022 Gazi Entomological Research Society.

The ligand exchange provides a broad range of exchange energies, ΔEJ, from +50 to -200 meV, with 80% of the ligands yielding a small ΔEJ < 10 meV. We identify descriptors for the classification and regression of ΔEJ using gradient boosting machine learning models. We compare one-hot encoded, structure-based, and chemical descriptors consisting of the HOMO/LUMO energies of the individual ligands and the maximum electronegativity difference and bond order for the ligand atom connecting to Co. We observe a similar overall performance with the chemical descriptors outperforming the other descriptors.

In particular, annealing machines that use the Ising model of statistical mechanics are emerging and feasible next-generation computational technology. Annealing machines can solve combinatorial optimization problems that have been considered difficult to solve in classical computing principles. Currently, Ising-based algorithms are being vigorously developed to perform various applications such as machine learning by solving them as combinatorial optimization problems. On the other hand, the amount of data, such as sensor data and simulation data, used in machine learning applications is drastically increasing. It becomes difficult to handle large amounts of data. In particular, since the number of qubits of annealing machines is limited, Ising-based algorithms independent of data size are strongly required. This paper focuses on Ising-based linear regression that utilizes a precision vector instead of each data element of target data. Although the use of a precision vector is a key point that can reduce the number of qubits against the amount of data, detail such as how many elements of a precision vector is necessary and how these elements are set to be is not clarified yet. This paper discusses the characteristics of a precision vector through performance evaluation of Ising-based linear regression with a practical data set in empirical ways.

Using a quantum feature map, the data are mapped to quantum states belonging to a quantum feature space, where the associated kernel is determined by the inner product between the quantum states. This quantum kernel can be efficiently estimated on a quantum computer.

However, such calculations are extremely computationally demanding as more than millions of cluster configurations might exist and need to be computed. We present an efficient approach to produce high quality QC data sets for applications in cluster formation studies and how to train an accurate quantum machine learning model on the generated data. Using the two-component sulfuric acid-water system as a proof of concept, we demonstrate that a kernel ridge regression machine learning model with Δ-learning can be trained to accurately predict the binding energies of cluster equilibrium configurations with mean absolute errors below 0.5 kcal mol-1. Additionally, we enlarge the training data set with nonequilibrium configurations and show the possibility of predicting the binding energies of new structures of clusters several molecules larger than those in the training set. Applying the trained machine learning model leads to a drastic reduction in the number of relevant clusters that need to be explicitly evaluated by QC methods. The presented approach is directly transferable to clusters of arbitrary composition and will lead to faster and more efficient exploration of the configurational space of new cluster systems. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Mobile users' trajectories prediction belongs to the task of temporal information processing, and it is a mobility management problem that is essential for self-organising and autonomous 6G networks. Our aim is to accurately predict the future positions of mobile users in wireless networks using QRC. To do so, the authors use a real-world time series dataset to model mobile users' trajectories. The QRC approach has two components: reservoir computing (RC) and quantum computing (QC). In RC, the training is more computational-efficient than the training of simple recurrent neural networks since, in RC, only the weights of the output layer are trainable. The internal part of RC is what is called the reservoir. For the RC to perform well, the weights of the reservoir should be chosen carefully to create highly complex and non-linear dynamics. The QC is used to create such dynamical reservoir that maps the input time series into higher dimensional computational space composed of dynamical states. After obtaining the high-dimensional dynamical states, a simple linear regression is performed to train the output weights and, thus, the prediction of the mobile users' trajectories can be performed efficiently. In this study, we apply a QRC approach based on the Hamiltonian time evolution of a quantum system. The authors simulate the time evolution using IBM gate-based quantum computers, and they show in the experimental results that the use of QRC to predict the mobile users' trajectories with only a few qubits is efficient and can outperform the classical approaches such as the long short-term memory approach and the echo-state networks approach. © 2023 The Authors.

In quantum machine learning, the gates of a quantum circuit are parameterized, and the parameters are tuned via classical optimization based on data and on measurements of the outputs of the circuit. Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) can efficiently address combinatorial optimization problems, implement probabilistic generative models, and carry out inference (classification and regression). This monograph provides a self-contained introduction to quantum machine learning for an audience of engineers with a background in probability and linear algebra.

In order to make up for this deficiency, this paper proposes a quantum fuzzy regression model, which uses fuzzy theory to describe the uncertainty in big data sets and uses quantum computing to exponentially improve the efficiency of data set preprocessing and parameter estimation. In this paper, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to calculate the degree of importance of each data point. Meanwhile, Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd (HHL) algorithm and quantum swap circuits are used to improve the efficiency of high-dimensional data matrix calculation. The application of the quantum fuzzy regression model to small-scale financial data proves that its accuracy is greatly improved compared with the quantum regression model. Moreover, due to the introduction of quantum computing, the speed of dealing with high-dimensional data matrix has an exponential improvement compared with the fuzzy regression model. The quantum fuzzy regression model proposed in this paper combines the advantages of fuzzy theory and quantum computing which can efficiently calculate high-dimensional data matrix and complete parameter estimation using quantum computing while retaining the uncertainty in big data. Thus, it is a new model for efficient and accurate big data processing in uncertain environments. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

The training of these is however, still a compute-intensive problem that grows drastically with the layer size and data input. At the core of this calculation is the linear regression problem. The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) quantum algorithm has gained relevance thanks to its promise of providing a quantum state containing the solution of a linear system of equations. The solution is encoded in superposition at the output of a quantum circuit. Although this seems to provide the answer to the linear regression problem for the training neural networks, it also comes with multiple, difficult-to-avoid hurdles.

Since several ML classification algorithms, such as deep neural networks, support vector machines-SVM (and hyperplane decisions in general), Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, etc., can be expressed in terms of matrix operations, initially we propose novel secure matrix operations as our building blocks.

As our underlying cryptographic primitives are shown to be resilient to quantum computer attacks, our algorithms are also suitable for the post-quantum world. Our theoretical analysis and extensive experimental evaluations show that our secure matrix operations, hence our secure ML algorithms build on top of them as well, outperform the state of the art schemes in terms of computation and communication costs.

Airline companies are changing tickets' prices very often considering a variety of factors based on their proprietary rules and algorithms that are searching for the most suitable price policy. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are exploited for the latter task, due to their compactness, fast adaptability, and many potentials in data generalization. This paper represents an analysis of airfare price prediction towards finding similarities in the pricing policies of different Airline companies by using AI Techniques. More specifically, a set of effective features is extracted from 136.917 data flights of Aegean, Turkish, Austrian and Lufthansa Airlines for six popular international destinations. The extracted set of features is then used to conduct a holistic analysis from the perspective of the end user who seeks the most affordable ticket cost, considering a destination-based evaluation including all airlines, and an airline-based evaluation including all destinations. For the latter cause, AI models from three different domains and a total of 16 model architectures are considered to resolve the airfare price prediction problem: Machine Learning (ML) with eight state-of-the-art models, Deep Learning (DL) with six CNN models and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) with two models.

Namely, suppose we are given an A ∈ ℂm×n with minimum non-zero singular value σ which supports certain efficient ℓ2-norm importance sampling queries, along with a b ∈ ℂm. Then, for some x ∈ ℂn satisfying ||x - A+b|| ≤ ε||A+b||, we can output a measurement of |x〉 in the computational basis and output an entry of x with classical algorithms that run in (equation presented) and (equation presented) time, respectively. This improves on previous “quantum-inspired” algorithms in this line of research by at least a factor of (equation presented) [Chia, Gilyén, Li, Lin, Tang, and Wang, STOC'20]. As a consequence, we show that quantum computers can achieve at most a factor-of-12 speedup for linear regression in this QRAM data structure setting and related settings.

We thus propose a correction method using learning-based error mitigation for hybrid quantum-classical machine learning, which can be used by experimenters without prior knowledge of the quantum noise channel models. A correction function using linear regression models inspired by the depolarizing noise channel is trained, and the function is to correct classical probabilities of each qubit of the quantum circuit for the quantum machine learning model. In constructing the training data for the correction function, we assume that quantum circuit simulators yield classical probabilities with the noise-free state as the ground truth.

Researchers have formulated and executed a plethora of bug forecasting methodologies by computing the performance in terms of precision and difficulty. Various statistical models are established in the literature to observe bug existence and restoring method; these models are termed software reliability growth models. The existence of bugs in software is primarily because of the constant variations in the software code. Open source software is prevalent amongst academicians and has found users in big businesses. OSS is extremely effective, but source code variations have to be made regularly through the progressively advanced requirement at the user’s end. The open source group is expanding rapidly, and numerous categories of provisions are offered. Stakeholders contribute to OSS in business by reinforcing the value of schemes, taking into account great revenue earnings and novel scheme expansion. An essential feature of open source software is determining when to issue a novel form. The principal goal is to announce the software at a suitable time with minimal economic restrictions. The approach after announcing software is a challenge and announcement development performs a vital function in handling effective announcements to clients. It is essentially a group of novel characteristics that are combined to form an invention setting. The primary announcement is just after the expansion procedure and additional consequent announcements are founded upon the preceding announcements, number of prerequisites, and faults restored. Each announcement incorporates a collection of characteristics fulfilling particular restrictions of the corporation as required by the customers. Forming conclusions about what characteristics are to be encompassed in which announcement is a tiresome job. Information theory, which deals with computation and communication of knowledge around a network, was primarily invented by Claude E Shannon. It is a probabilistic established method that emphasizes the computation of vagueness associating data. It has widespread prospective functions in areas including model recognition, statistical interpretation, natural language processing, thermal physics, quantum computing, etc. Entropy is a significant subdivision of information theory that performs a principal function in examining the code change procedure. It is a quantity of uncertainty/difficulty of code change and portrays the quantity of information covered in an event.

We provide a first evaluation on the performance of these classifiers when using a hyperparameter search on six widely known and publicly available benchmark datasets and analyze how their performance varies with the number of samples on two artificially generated test classification datasets. As quantum machine learning is based on unitary transformations, this paper explores data structures and application fields that could be particularly suitable for quantum advantages. Hereby, this paper introduces a novel dataset based on concepts from quantum mechanics using the exponential map of a Lie algebra. This dataset will be made publicly available and contributes a novel contribution to the empirical evaluation of quantum supremacy. We further compared the performance of VQC and QKE on six widely applicable datasets to contextualize our results. Our results demonstrate that the VQC and QKE perform better than basic machine learning algorithms, such as advanced linear regression models (Ridge and Lasso). They do not match the accuracy and runtime performance of sophisticated modern boosting classifiers such as XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost. Therefore, we conclude that while quantum machine learning algorithms have the potential to surpass classical machine learning methods in the future, especially when physical quantum infrastructure becomes widely available, they currently lag behind classical approaches. Our investigations also show that classical machine learning approaches have superior performance classifying datasets based on group structures, compared to quantum approaches that particularly use unitary processes. Furthermore, our findings highlight the significant impact of different quantum simulators, feature maps, and quantum circuits on the performance of the employed quantum estimators. This observation emphasizes the need for researchers to provide detailed explanations of their hyperparameter choices for quantum machine learning algorithms, as this aspect is currently overlooked in many studies within the field. To facilitate further research in this area and ensure the transparency of our study, we have made the complete code available in a linked GitHub repository. © 2023 by the authors.",boost classifiers; CatBoost; classification; Lasso; LightGBM; neural networks; Qiskit; quantum computing; quantum kernel estimator; quantum machine learning; Ridge; variational quantum circuit; XGBoost,,,Article

In this paper, we reformulate gradient boosting such that it is able to generate a sequence of improvements to a nonconstant model, which may contain prior knowledge or physical insight about the data generating process. Moreover, we introduce a simple variant of multi-target stacking that extends our approach to the setting of multi-target regression. An experiment on a real-world superconducting quantum device calibration dataset demonstrates that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art calibration model even though it only receives a paucity of training examples.

Model training can be viewed as a form of optimization used to fit a machine learning model to a set of data, which can take up significant amount of time on classical computers. Adiabatic quantum computers have been shown to excel at solving optimization problems, and therefore, we believe, present a promising alternative to improve machine learning training times. In this paper, we present an adiabatic quantum computing approach for training a linear regression model. In order to do this, we formulate the regression problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. We analyze our quantum approach theoretically, test it on the D-Wave adiabatic quantum computer and compare its performance to a classical approach that uses the Scikit-learn library in Python. Our analysis shows that the quantum approach attains up to 2.8 × speedup over the classical approach on larger datasets, and performs at par with the classical approach on the regression error metric. The quantum approach used the D-Wave 2000Q adiabatic quantum computer, whereas the classical approach used a desktop workstation with an 8-core Intel i9 processor. As such, the results obtained in this work must be interpreted within the context of the specific hardware and software implementations of these machines. © 2021, The Author(s).",,adiabaticity; article; human; linear regression analysis; software; theoretical study,,Article

The convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models transformed the OCL problems into a regression task. However, the abundant semantic information of the crowd scenes may lead the CNN framework hard to extract adequate features in order to ensure good precision In this work, a Quantum Image Feature Extraction with Dense Distribution-Aware Learning (QE-DAL) framework was proposed to handle this problem. The crowd features were extracted by Quantum layers, which were extracted by encoding, quantum circuits and decode procedures based on the multi-scale architecture. For handling objects, the refined distance compensating operator was adopted to fuse the multi-scale architecture. To relieve the computation burden, a Gaussian distribution estimation mechanism was proposed to initiate and update the bounding sizes of the objects via a point-supervised manner. Finally, the joint loss function, which describes pixel classes, density maps and offset bounding boxes, was built for QE-DAL. The ablation experiment results demonstrated that the effectiveness of the quantum feature extraction architecture and the Gaussian distribution estimation mechanism of QE-DAL was validated to show superior performance than the other state-of-the-art framework. Moreover, the generalization of the QE-DAL was evidenced by the Cross-scene learning evaluation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Distribution aware learning; Object counting and localization; Quantum computing; Refined distance compensating,Convolutional neural networks; Extraction; Gaussian distribution; Image processing; Network architecture; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Semantics; Convolutional neural network; Distribution aware learning; Distribution estimation; Image feature extractions; Multi-scales; Object counting; Object localization; Quantum Computing; Quantum images; Refined distance compensating; Feature extraction,,Article

In quantum machine learning, a quantum computer has been found useful for enhanced feature representation and high-dimensional state or function approximation. Quantum–classical hybrid algorithms have been proposed in recent years for this purpose under the noisy intermediate-scale quantum computer (NISQ) environment. Under this scheme, the role played by the classical computer is the parameter tuning, parameter optimization, and parameter update for the quantum circuit. In this paper, we propose a gradient descent-based backpropagation algorithm that can efficiently calculate the gradient in parameter optimization and update the parameter for quantum circuit learning, which outperforms the current parameter search algorithms in terms of computing speed while presenting the same or even higher test accuracy. Meanwhile, the proposed theoretical scheme was successfully implemented on the 20-qubit quantum computer of IBM Q, ibmq_johannesburg. The experimental results reveal that the gate error, especially the CNOT gate error, strongly affects the derived gradient accuracy. The regression accuracy performed on the IBM Q becomes lower with the increase in the number of measurement shot times due to the accumulated gate noise error. © 2021 by the authors.

To this end, this paper addresses the scenario where a server has a private trained ML model, and one or more clients have private queries that they wish to classify using the server's model. During the process, the server learns nothing, while the clients learn only their final classifications and nothing else. Several ML classification algorithms, such as Deep Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, different flavors of Naïve Bayes, etc., can be expressed in terms of linear algebra operations. To this end, initially, as building blocks, several novel secure linear algebra operations are proposed. On top of them novel secure ML classification algorithms are proposed for the aforementioned classifiers under strict security, privacy and efficiency constraints and their security is proven under the semi-honest model. Since the used underlying cryptographic primitives are shown to be resilient to quantum computer attacks, the proposed algorithms are also suitable for the post-quantum world. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms are non-interactive and, based on where the bulk of the operations are done, they have the flexibility to be server or client centric. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental evaluations over benchmark datasets show that the proposed secure linear algebra operations, hence the secure ML algorithms build on top of them, outperform the state-of-the-art schemes in terms of computation and communication costs as well as on security and privacy characteristics. Moreover, and to the best of the authors’ knowledge, for the first time in literature the security of the proposed algorithms is proven when dealing with multiple malicious clients during classifications. © 2023 The Author(s)",Machine learning classification; Malicious clients; Novel secure linear algebra; Post-quantum cryptography; Privacy preserving algorithms,,,Article

QMLMaterial is an artificial intelligence (AI) software based on the active learning method, which uses machine learning regression algorithms and their uncertainties for decision making on the next unexplored structures to be computed, increasing the probability of finding the global minimum with few calculations as more data is obtained. The software has different acquisition functions for decision making (e.g., expected improvement and lower confidence bound). Also, the Gaussian process is available in the AI framework for regression, where the uncertainty is obtained analytically from Bayesian statistics. For the artificial neural network and support vector regressor algorithms, the uncertainty can be obtained by K-fold cross-validation or nonparametric bootstrap resampling methods. The software is interfaced with several quantum chemistry codes and atomic descriptors, such as the many-body tensor representation.

We detail a process in which data from single-shot experimental measurements are used to optimize an isometric tensor network, the isometric tensors are compiled into unitary quantum operations using greedy compilation heuristics, parameter optimization on the resulting quantum circuit model removes the postselection requirements of the isometric tensor model, and the resulting quantum model is inferenced on either product state (single-shot measurement) or entangled quantum data. We demonstrate our training and inference architecture on a synthetic dataset of six-site single-shot measurements from the bulk of a one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM) deep in its antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases. We find that increasing the bond dimension of the tensor-network model, amounting to adding more ancilla qubits to the circuit representation, improves both the average number of correct classifications across the dataset and the single-shot probability of correct classification. We experimentally evaluate models on Quantinuum's H1-2 trapped ion quantum computer using entangled input data modeled as translationally invariant, bond dimension 4 MPSs across the known quantum phase transition of the TFIM. Using linear regression on the experimental data near the transition point, we find predictions for the critical transverse field of h=0.962 and 0.994 for tensor-network discriminators of bond dimension χ=2 and χ=4, respectively. These predictions compare favorably with the known transition location of h=1 despite training on data far from the transition point.

Existing quantum algorithms have demonstrated the potential for large speedups, but the required quantum resources are not immediately available on near-term quantum devices. In this work, we study near-term quantum algorithms for linear systems of equations, with a focus on the two-norm and Tikhonov regression settings. We investigate the use of variational algorithms and analyze their optimization landscapes. There exist types of linear systems for which variational algorithms designed to avoid barren plateaus, such as properly-initialized imaginary time evolution and adiabatic-inspired optimization, suffer from a different plateau problem. To circumvent this issue, we design near-term algorithms based on a core idea: the classical combination of variational quantum states (CQS). We exhibit several provable guarantees for these algorithms, supported by the representation of the linear system on a so-called ansatz tree. The CQS approach and the ansatz tree also admit the systematic application of heuristic approaches, including a gradient-based search. We have conducted numerical experiments solving linear systems as large as 2300 × 2300 by considering cases where we can simulate the quantum algorithm efficiently on a classical computer. Our methods may provide benefits for solving linear systems within the reach of near-term quantum devices. © 2021 The Author(s).

In many real world problems, its beneficial to perform sparse linear regression to identify important features helpful in predicting the dependent variable. It not only helps in getting interpretable results but also avoids overfitting when the number of features is large, and the amount of data is small. The most natural way to achieve this is by using ‘best subset selection’ which penalizes non-zero model parameters by adding ℓ0 norm over parameters to the least squares loss. However, this makes the objective function non-convex and intractable even for a small number of features. This paper aims to address the intractability of sparse linear regression with ℓ0 norm using adiabatic quantum computing, a quantum computing paradigm that is particularly useful for solving optimization problems faster. We formulate the ℓ0 optimization problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and solve it using the D-Wave adiabatic quantum computer. We study and compare the quality of QUBO solution on synthetic and real world datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adiabatic quantum computing approach in finding the optimal solution. The QUBO solution matches the optimal solution for a wide range of sparsity penalty values across the datasets. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Adiabatic quantum computing; Feature selection; Sparse linear regression,Optimal systems; Optimization; Quantum computers; Binary optimization; Dependent variables; Independent variables; Machine learning approaches; Objective functions; Optimization problems; Real-world datasets; Sparse linear regressions; Linear regression,"21st International Conference on Computational Science, ICCS 2021",Conference paper

In this research, we explore the impact of quantum algorithms on the time complexity of quantum state tomography based on the linear regression algorithm if quantum states can be efficiently prepared by classical information and quantum algorithms can be implemented on quantum computers. By studying current quantum algorithms based on quantum singular value decomposition (SVE) of calculating matrix multiplication, solving linear equations and eigenvalue and eigenstate estimation and so on, we propose a novel scheme to complete the mission of quantum state tomography. We show the calculation based on our algorithm as an example at last. Although quantum state preparations and extra measurements are indispensable in our quantum algorithm scheme compared with the existing classical algorithm, the time complexity of quantum state tomography can be remarkably declined. For a quantum system with dimension d, the entire quantum scheme can reduce the time complexity of quantum state tomography from O (d4) to O (d poly log d) when both the condition number κ of related matrices and the reciprocal of precision ε are O (poly log d), and quantum states of the same order O (d) can be simultaneously prepared. This is in contrast to the observation that quantum algorithms can reduce the time complexity of quantum state tomography to O ( d3) when quantum states can not be efficiently prepared. In other words, the preparing of quantum states efficiently has become a bottleneck constraining the quantum acceleration. © 2019 Chinese Physical Society.",Quantum algorithm; Quantum state tomography; Time complexity,Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Number theory; Quantum optics; Qubits; Singular value decomposition; Tomography; Classical information; Condition numbers; Linear regression algorithms; MAtrix multiplication; Quantum algorithms; Quantum state preparation; Quantum state tomography; Time complexity; Quantum efficiency,,Article

Machine learning models based on FCHL19 are able to yield predictions of atomic forces and energies of query compounds with chemical accuracy on the scale of milliseconds. FCHL19 is a revision of our previous work [F. A. Faber et al., J. Chem. Phys. 148, 241717 (2018)] where the representation is discretized and the individual features are rigorously optimized using Monte Carlo optimization. Combined with a Gaussian kernel function that incorporates elemental screening, chemical accuracy is reached for energy learning on the QM7b and QM9 datasets after training for minutes and hours, respectively. The model also shows good performance for non-bonded interactions in the condensed phase for a set of water clusters with a mean absolute error (MAE) binding energy error of less than 0.1 kcal/mol/molecule after training on 3200 samples. For force learning on the MD17 dataset, our optimized model similarly displays state-of-the-art accuracy with a regressor based on Gaussian process regression. When the revised FCHL19 representation is combined with the operator quantum machine learning regressor, forces and energies can be predicted in only a few milliseconds per atom.

The elemental components help us to lower the QML model's learning curve, and, through interpolation across the periodic table, even enable ""alchemical extrapolation"" to covalent bonding between elements not part of training. This point is demonstrated for the prediction of covalent binding in single, double, and triple bonds among main-group elements as well as for atomization energies in organic molecules.

Motivated by quantum linear algebra algorithms and the quantum singular value transformation (SVT) framework of Gilyén et al. [STOC'19], we develop classical algorithms for SVT that run in time independent of input dimension, under suitable quantum-inspired sampling assumptions. Our results give compelling evidence that in the corresponding QRAM data structure input model, quantum SVT does not yield exponential quantum speedups. Since the quantum SVT framework generalizes essentially all known techniques for quantum linear algebra, our results, combined with sampling lemmas from previous work, suffices to generalize all recent results about dequantizing quantum machine learning algorithms. In particular, our classical SVT framework recovers and often improves the dequantization results on recommendation systems, principal component analysis, supervised clustering, support vector machines, low-rank regression, and semidefinite program solving. We also give additional dequantization results on low-rank Hamiltonian simulation and discriminant analysis. Our improvements come from identifying the key feature of the quantum-inspired input model that is at the core of all prior quantum-inspired results: g.,""2-norm sampling can approximate matrix products in time independent of their dimension.

We performed calculations at MP2/cc-pVTZ (n = 0-16), CCSD/cc-pVDZ (n = 0-12) and CCSD/cc-pVTZ (n = 0-6) levels. The dipole moments from the best treatment, CCSD/cc-pVTZ, are in much closer agreement with those obtained in CCSD/cc-pVDZ calculations (deviations up to 0.05 Debye) than with the results from MP2/ cc-pVTZ (discrepancies that can reach 0.55 Debye). Moreover, the CCSD/cc-pVTZ level yields values in excellent accordance with experimental dipole moments for HNC and HC2NC. Hence, this allows concluding that the correct treatment of electron correlation is more important than increments in basis sets for this electric property in isocyanopolyynes and CCSD/cc-pVDZ values are indicated as the best estimates available for large isocyanopolyynes. The findings from infrared intensities of fundamental vibrational bands are also similar (mean deviations of 3.1 km mol -1for CCSD/cc-pVDZ and 12.6 km mol-1for MP2/cc-pVTZ with respect to CCSD/cc-pVTZ results). Thus, we decided to use the charge - charge flux - dipole flux (CCFDF) model from multipoles given by the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM), which were obtained at the CCSD/cc-pVDZ level, to investigate the variations in infrared intensities of some selected modes along these systems. The intensity of the band associated with CH stretching shows an increase with the size of these molecules (from 96 to 146 km mol -1between n = 4 and 12) that is readily explained by variations in the charge flux contribution to this mode, in a similar way as found before for cyanopolyynes. Furthermore, the degenerate CH bending vibrations present almost constant intensities in these isocyanopolyynes (around 37-38 km mol -1from n = 4 up to n = 12) and this pattern is supported by CCFDF/QTAIM contributions. The band mostly assigned to stretching of the NC triple bond, which can also be described as asymmetric stretching mode of all pairs of adjacent triple bonds, shows an increase of intensity up to n = 6 and is associated to values around 96-102 km mol-1in the remaining larger members. Another important mode detected is a symmetric stretching of NC and CC triple bonds belonging to the isonitrile end (between 66 and 101 km mol1 when n = 6-12) for which the charge contribution is nearly constant and dynamic contributions change in a more complicated way. The most intense fundamental band in each isocyanopolyyne from n = 4 to 12 is assigned to vibrations of triple bonds in both ends of these systems (from 129 to 164 km mol-1) and an alternating behavior according with even or odd numbers of CC triple bonds is observed for these values and also for respective CCFDF/QTAIM contributions. Finally, this work also brings values derived from regressions that are indicated as the best estimates of rotational constants and dipole moments to be used for detection of large isocyanopolyynes in the interstellar medium. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The support vector regression (SVR) model can be hybridized with novel meta-heuristic algorithms not only to identify fluctuations and the nonlinear tendencies of electric loads, but also to generate satisfactory forecasts. However, many such algorithms have numerous drawbacks, such as a low population diversity and trapping at local optima, which are problems of premature convergence. Accordingly, approaches to increase the accuracy of forecasting must be developed. In this investigation, quantum computing mechanism is used to quantamize dragonfly behaviors to enhance the searching effectiveness of the dragonfly algorithm, namely QDA. In addition, conducting the data preprocessing by the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) is useful to improve the forecasting accuracy. Thus, a new electric load forecasting model, the CEEMDAN-SVRQDA model, that combines the CEEMDAN and hybridizes the QDA with an SVR model, is proposed to provide more accurate forecasts.

We develop a new “Quantum singular value transformation” algorithm that can directly harness the advantages of exponential dimensionality by applying polynomial transformations to the singular values of a block of a unitary operator. The transformations are realized by quantum circuits with a very simple structure – typically using only a constant number of ancilla qubits – leading to optimal algorithms with appealing constant factors. We show that our framework allows describing many quantum algorithms on a high level, and enables remarkably concise proofs for many prominent quantum algorithms, ranging from optimal Hamiltonian simulation to various quantum machine learning applications.

In this work, we compare a variety of machine-learning algorithms derived from diverse fields for the task of state estimation (retrodiction) and forward prediction of future qubit-state evolution for a single qubit subject to classical, non-Markovian dephasing. Our approaches involve the construction of a dynamical model capturing qubit dynamics via autoregressive or Fourier-type protocols using only a historical record of projective measurements. A detailed comparison of achievable prediction horizons, model robustness, and measurement-noise-filtering capabilities for Kalman filters (KFs) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) algorithms is provided. We demonstrate superior performance from the autoregressive KF relative to Fourier-based KF approaches and focus on the role of filter optimization in achieving suitable performance. Finally, we examine several realizations of GPR using different kernels and discover that these approaches are generally not suitable for forward prediction.

This has motivated the creation of quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEAs), which successfully use some quantum physics principles to improve the performance of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for classical computers. This paper proposes a novel QIEA (Quantum-Inspired Linear Genetic Programming - QILGP) for automatic synthesis of machine code (MC) programs and aims to present a preliminary evaluation of applying the quantum-inspiration paradigm to evolve programs by using two symbolic regression problems. QILGP performance is compared to AIMGP model, since it is the most successful genetic programming technique to evolve MC. In the first problem, the hit ratio of QILGP (100%) is greater than the one of AIMGP (77%). In the second problem, QILGP seems to carry on a less greedy search than AIMGP. Since QILGP presents some satisfactory results, this paper shows that the quantum-inspiration paradigm can be a competitive approach to evolve programs more efficiently, which encourages further developments of that first and simplest QILGP model with multiple individuals. © 2009 IEEE.",,Computational efficiency; Genetic programming; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Automatic synthesis; Direct use; Further development; Genetic programming technique; Greedy search; Hit ratio; Linear genetic programming; Machine codes; Quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm; Quantum mechanical; Quantum physics; Specific problems; Symbolic regression problems; Evolutionary algorithms,"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, CEC 2009",Conference paper

It often serves as a preprocessing step to surmount the curse of dimensionality and to gain efficiency, and thus it plays an important role in machine learning and data mining. In this paper, we present a quantum algorithm that compresses an exponentially large high-dimensional but approximately low-rank dataset in quantum parallel, by dimensionality reduction (DR) based on principal component analysis (PCA), the most popular classical DR algorithm. We show that the proposed algorithm has a runtime polylogarithmic in the dataset’s size and dimensionality, which is exponentially faster than the classical PCA algorithm, when the original dataset is projected onto a polylogarithmically low-dimensional space. The compressed dataset can then be further processed to implement other tasks of interest, with significantly less quantum resources. As examples, we apply this algorithm to reduce data dimensionality for two important quantum machine learning algorithms, quantum support vector machine and quantum linear regression for prediction.

We construct implicit descriptions of the pseudo-inverse by finding approximate singular value decomposition of A via subsampling, then inverting the singular values. In principle, our approaches can also be used to apply any desired “smooth” function to the singular values.

This paper observes that, despite considerable variation in the techniques employed by the various researchers and research groups that produced these human-competitive results, many of the results share several common features. Many of the results were achieved by using a developmental process and by using native representations regularly used by engineers in the fields involved.

When combined with quantum machine learning (QML) models, the resulting CQML model is a generalized unified recursive kernel ridge regression that exploits correlations implicitly encoded in training data composed of multiple levels in multiple dimensions. Here, we have investigated up to three dimensions: chemical space, basis set, and electron correlation treatment. Numerical results have been obtained for atomization energies of a set of ∼7000 organic molecules with up to 7 atoms (not counting hydrogens) containing CHONFClS, as well as for ∼6000 constitutional isomers of C                             7                             H                             10                             O                             2                             . CQML learning curves for atomization energies suggest a dramatic reduction in necessary training samples calculated with the most accurate and costly method. In order to generate millisecond estimates of CCSD(T)/cc-pvdz atomization energies with prediction errors reaching chemical accuracy (∼1 kcal/mol), the CQML model requires only ∼100 training instances at CCSD(T)/cc-pvdz level, rather than thousands within conventional QML, while more training molecules are required at lower levels. Our results suggest a possibly favorable trade-off between various hierarchical approximations whose computational cost scales differently with electron number.                          © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,,,Article

Gaussian process regression is a widely used technique in supervised classical machine learning. Here we introduce an algorithm for Gaussian process regression using continuous-variable quantum systems that can be realized with technology based on photonic quantum computers under certain assumptions regarding distribution of data and availability of efficient quantum access. Our algorithm shows that by using a continuous-variable quantum computer a dramatic speedup in computing Gaussian process regression can be achieved, i.e., the possibility of exponentially reducing the time to compute. Furthermore, our results also include a continuous-variable quantum-assisted singular value decomposition method of nonsparse low rank matrices and forms an important subroutine in our Gaussian process regression algorithm. © 2018 American Physical Society.",,Artificial intelligence; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Learning systems; Matrix algebra; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Regression analysis; Subroutines; Continuous variables; Gaussian process regression; Low-rank matrices; Quantum system; Singular value decomposition method; Technology-based; Singular value decomposition,,Article

We introduce a method to train SVMs on a D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer and study its performance in comparison to SVMs trained on conventional computers. The method is applied to both synthetic data and real data obtained from biology experiments. We find that the quantum annealer produces an ensemble of different solutions that often generalizes better to unseen data than the single global minimum of an SVM trained on a conventional computer, especially in cases where only limited training data is available. For cases with more training data than currently fits on the quantum annealer, we show that a combination of classifiers for subsets of the data almost always produces stronger joint classifiers than the conventional SVM for the same parameters. © 2019 The Author(s)",Classification; Kernel-based SVM; Machine learning; Quantum annealing; Quantum computation; Support vector machine,Annealing; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Quantum computers; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Combination of classifiers; Conventional computers; Kernel-based SVM; Limited training data; Quantum annealing; Regression problem; Supervised machine learning; Support vector machine (SVMs); Classification (of information),,Article

Here, we develop a quantum algorithm for sampling from this optimized distribution over features, in runtime O(D) that is linear in the dimension D of the input data. Our algorithm achieves an exponential speedup in D compared to any known classical algorithm for this sampling task. In contrast to existing quantum machine learning algorithms, our algorithm circumvents sparsity and low-rank assumptions and thus has wide applicability.

In our framework, data information is encoded in a qubit system, while information processing is tackled using auxiliary continuous qumodes via qubit-qumode interactions. Moreover, it is also elaborated that finite squeezing is quite helpful for efficiently running the quantum algorithms in a realistic setup.

Machine learning models are effective means to reveal interaction mechanisms. Here we studied the ability of a quantum machine learning approach to classify and rank binding affinities. Using simplified data sets of a small number of DNA sequences derived from actual binding affinity experiments, we trained a commercially available quantum annealer to classify and rank transcription factor binding. The results were compared to state-of-the-art classical approaches for the same simplified data sets, including simulated annealing, simulated quantum annealing, multiple linear regression, LASSO, and extreme gradient boosting. Despite technological limitations, we find a slight advantage in classification performance and nearly equal ranking performance using the quantum annealer for these fairly small training data sets. Thus, we propose that quantum annealing might be an effective method to implement machine learning for certain computational biology problems. © 2018, The Author(s).",,Annealing; Binding energy; Bioinformatics; Classification (of information); DNA sequences; Learning systems; Linear regression; Quantum theory; Simulated annealing; Transcription; Transcription factors; Classification performance; Computational biology; Interaction mechanisms; Machine learning models; Multiple linear regressions; Ranking performance; Technological limitations; Transcription factor binding; Learning to rank,,Article

The recently proposed bat algorithm (BA), compared with classical GA and PSO algorithm, has greater potential in forecasting accuracy improvements. However, the original BA still suffers from the embedded drawbacks, including trapping in local optima and premature convergence. Hence, to continue exploring possible improvements of the original BA and to receive more appropriate parameters of an SVR model, this paper applies quantum computing mechanism to empower each bat to possess quantum behavior, then, employs the chaotic mapping function to execute the global chaotic disturbance process, to enlarge bat's search space and to make the bat jump out from the local optima when population is over accumulation. This paper presents a novel load forecasting approach, namely SVRCQBA model, by hybridizing the SVR model with the quantum computing mechanism, chaotic mapping function, and BA, to receive higher forecasting accuracy.

Several linear and nonlinear regression models like Langmuir, Freundlich, D-R, Tempkin isotherm models are in vogue for determining the adsorbing capacity of standard adsorbents used for this purpose. In this article, we propose a novel quantum inspired backpropagation multilayer perceptron (QBMLP) based on quantum gates (single qubit rotation gates and two qubit controlled-not gates) for the prediction of this adsorption behavior exhibited by calcareous soil oftentimes used in adsorbing miscible iron from aqueous solutions. The backpropagation learning formulae for the proposed QBMLP architecture has also been generalized for multiple number of layers in both field homogeneous and field heterogeneous configurations characterized by three standard activations, viz., sigmoid, tanh and tan 1.5h functions. Applications of the efficiency of the proposed QBMLP over the regression models are demonstrated with regards to the prediction behavior of the adsorption of iron by calcareous soil from an aqueous solution with effect to various characteristic adsorbent parameters. The adsorption process is considered to be a physical one since the activation energy (EA) of ferrous ion adsorption is 9.469 kJ mol-1 due to Arrhenius. Moreover, the thermodynamic parameters of Gibb's free energy (G0), enthalpy (H0) and entropy (S0) values indicate it be spontaneous. Results indicate that QBMLP predicts the adsorption behavior of calcareous soil to a very closer extent thereby obviating the need for further regression/experimental analysis. Comparison with the performance of a similar classical multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture also reveals the prediction and time efficiency of the proposed QBMLP architecture. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The field is attracting ever-increasing attention from both academic and private sectors, as testified by the recent demonstration of quantum supremacy in practice. However, the intrinsic restriction to linear operations significantly limits the range of relevant use cases for the application of Quantum Computing. In this work, we introduce a novel variational algorithm for quantum Single Layer Perceptron. Thanks to the universal approximation theorem, and given that the number of hidden neurons scales exponentially with the number of qubits, our framework opens to the possibility of approximating any function on quantum computers. Thus, the proposed approach produces a model with substantial descriptive power, and widens the horizon of potential applications already in the NISQ era, especially the ones related to Quantum Artificial Intelligence. In particular, we design a quantum circuit to perform linear combinations in superposition and discuss adaptations to classification and regression tasks. After this theoretical investigation, we also provide practical implementations using various simulation environments.

In particular, we propose to directly optimize basic loss functions of the prediction error metrics typically used in the literature, such as the mean absolute error or the worst case error. In some instances, a proper choice of the loss function can directly reduce reasonably the prediction performance in the desired metric, albeit at the cost of additional computations during training.

Our class of quantum reservoirs is universal, in that any nonlinear fading memory map can be approximated arbitrarily closely and uniformly over all inputs by a quantum reservoir from this class. We describe a subclass of the universal class that is readily implementable using quantum gates native to current noisy gate-model quantum computers.

The entire field of quantum machine learning gained considerable traction after the discovery of this celebrated algorithm. However, effective practical applications and experimental implementations of HHL are still sparse in the literature. Here, the authors demonstrate a potential practical utility of HHL, in the context of regression analysis, using the remarkable fact that there exists a natural reduction of any multiple linear regression problem to an equivalent linear systems problem. They put forward a 7-qubit quantum circuit design, motivated from an earlier work by Cao et al. [Mol.

In actual operation, batteries are seldom fully discharged. For a constant current-constant voltage charging mode, the incomplete discharging process affects not only the initial state but also processed variables of the subsequent charging profile, thereby mainly limiting the applications of many feature-based capacity estimation methods which rely on a whole cycling process. Since the charging information of the constant voltage profile can be completely saved whether the battery is fully discharged or not, a geometrical feature of the constant voltage charging profile is extracted to be a new aging feature of lithium-ion batteries under the incomplete discharging situation in this work. By introducing the quantum computing theory into the classical machine learning technique, an integrated quantum particle swarm optimization–based support vector regression estimation framework, as well as its application to characterize the relationship between extracted feature and battery remaining capacity, are presented and illustrated in detail. With the lithium-ion battery data provided by NASA, experiment and comparison results demonstrate the effectiveness, accuracy, and superiority of the proposed battery capacity estimation framework for the not entirely discharged condition. © 2018 Wang et al.

We develop several tools within the block-encoding framework, such as singular value estimation of a block-encoded matrix, and quantum linear system solvers using block-encodings. The presented results give new techniques for Hamiltonian simulation of non-sparse matrices, which could be relevant for certain quantum chemistry applications, and which in turn imply an exponential improvement in the dependence on precision in quantum linear systems solvers for non-sparse matrices. In addition, we develop a technique of variable-time amplitude estimation, based on Ambainis' variable-time amplitude amplification technique, which we are also able to apply within the framework. As applications, we design the following algorithms: (1) a quantum algorithm for the quantum weighted least squares problem, exhibiting a 6-th power improvement in the dependence on the condition number and an exponential improvement in the dependence on the precision over the previous best algorithm of Kerenidis and Prakash; (2) the first quantum algorithm for the quantum generalized least squares problem; and (3) quantum algorithms for estimating electrical-network quantities, including effective resistance and dissipated power, improving upon previous work. © S.

However, to date, the compaction quality assessment model has not been accurate enough, and no effective feedback control measures have been developed. Hybrid data mining algorithms have great potential for solving this problem. In this study, smart bacteria-foraging algorithm-based customized kernel support vector regression (SBFA-CKSVR) is proposed for compaction quality assessment, whereas an enhanced probabilistic neural network (EPNN) is adopted for compaction quality control. SBFA integrates a bacteria-foraging algorithm, chaos mapping, and adaptive and quantum computing to solve the high-dimensional complex problem effectively. CKSVR is proposed to approximate a function in quadratic continuous integral space L2(R) where its hyperparameters are optimized by SBFA. Finally, SBFA-CKSVR is used to establish a high-precision compaction quality assessment model whereas the EPNN is adopted to realize the compaction quality feedback control. A three-dimensional real-time monitoring system for the earth-rock dam is also developed based on SBFA-CKSVR and EPNN.

In the I-TLBO algorithm, there are four major highlights. Firstly, a quantum initialized population by using the qubits on Bloch sphere replaces a randomly initialized population. Secondly, two kinds of angles in Bloch sphere are generated by using cube chaos mapping. Thirdly, an adaptive control parameter is added into the teacher phase to speed up the convergent speed. And then, according to actual teaching-learning phenomenon of a classroom, students learn some knowledge not only by their teacher and classmates, but also by themselves. Therefore, a self-study strategy by using Gauss mutation is introduced after the learning phase to improve the exploration ability. Finally, we test the performance of the I-TLBO-PELM model.

Quantum evolutionary computing is a relatively recent spot-lighted concept which takes advantage from both the evolutionary and quantum computing laws. In general, QIEAs have been proven to be really powerful for optimising complex engineering tasks. The fascinating trait of observation operator in QIEA enables us to transform the quantum bits to both the binary and continuous spaces. Here, the authors present a mix continuous/binary version of QIEA, to find out whether it is suited for designing regularised EELMs. Indeed, the design process of EELM is conducted at two different levels, i.e. hyper and low levels. At the low level, some novel criteria are presented in the form of penalty functions to enable the optimiser searching for parsimonious, compact and accurate regularised extreme learning machines, as individual components of the ensemble. At the hyper-level, the non-negative least square error optimisation technique is utilised to deterministically find the most eligible components for designing the ensemble. Through extensive numerical experiments, the authors demonstrate that the proposed method is really efficient for the automated design of EELM identifiers. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",ensemble extreme learning machine; evolutionary ensemble design; quantum evolutionary algorithm; regression problems; regularisation penalty function,Algorithms; Design; Evolutionary algorithms; Knowledge acquisition; Learning algorithms; Numerical methods; Quantum computers; Evolutionary computing; Extreme learning machine; Hybrid quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms; Individual components; Optimisation techniques; Penalty function; Quantum evolutionary algorithms; Regression problem; Learning systems,,Article

A carefully constructed representation can lower the prediction error for out-of-sample data by several orders of magnitude with the same training data. This is a particularly desirable effect in data scarce scenarios, such as they are common in first principles based chemical compound space explorations. Unfortunately, representations which result in KRR models with low and steep learning curves for extensive properties, for example, energies, do not necessarily lead to well performing models for response properties. In this chapter we review the recently introduced FCHL18 representation (Faber et al., J Chem Phys 148(24):241717, 2018), in combination with kernel-based QML models to account for response properties by including the corresponding operators in the regression (Christensen et al., J Chem Phys 150(6):064105, 2019). FCHL18 was designed to describe an atom in its chemical environment, allowing to measure distances between elements in the periodic table, and consequently providing a metric for both structural and chemical similarities between compounds. The representation does not decouple the radial and angular degrees of freedom, which makes it well-suited for comparing atomic environments. QML models using FCHL18 display low and steep learning curves for energies of molecules, clusters, and crystals. By contrast, the same QML models exhibit less favorable learning for other properties, such as forces, electronic eigenvalues, or dipole moments. We discuss the use of the electric field differential operator within a kernel-based operator QML (OQML) approach. Using OQML results in the same predictive accuracy for molecular dipole norm, but with approximately 20× less training data, as directly learning the dipole norm with a KRR model. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,,Book chapter

It is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with various applications in human-computer interaction, security and surveillance, robot perception, traffic control, etc. In this paper, we address this problem in the quantum setting, and present a quantum algorithm for VT based on the framework proposed by Henriques et al. [IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell. 7, 583 (2015)ITPIDJ0162-882810.1109/TPAMI.2014.2345390]. Our algorithm comprises two phases: training and detection. In the training phase, in order to discriminate the object and background, the algorithm trains a ridge regression classifier in the quantum state form where the optimal fitting parameters of ridge regression are encoded in the amplitudes. In the detection phase, the classifier is then employed to generate a quantum state whose amplitudes encode the responses of all the candidate image patches. The algorithm is shown to be polylogarithmic in scaling, when the image data matrices have low condition numbers, and therefore may achieve exponential speedup over the best classical counterpart. However, only quadratic speedup can be achieved when the algorithm is applied to implement the ultimate task of Henriques's framework, i.e., detecting the object position. We also discuss two other important applications related to VT: (1) object disappearance detection and (2) motion behavior matching, where much more significant speedup over the classical methods can be achieved.

Inspired by the conventional FLN and quantum mechanics, this work proposes a kind of quantum-inspired double parallel feed-forward neural network (QIDPFNN). Compared with the FLN, the proposed algorithm presents two obvious differentials. Firstly, the input weights between hidden layer and input layer are generated by quantum computing. Secondly, a new hidden layer activation function is introduced. In order to verify the QIDPFNN validity, it is applied to 13 regression applications. The experimental results show that the QIDPFNN owns better generalization ability and stronger stability than FLN on most applications.

Guan Y.-H.,The effects of phonological recoding on taiwanese students’ reading processes: Evidence from eye tracking experiments,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology,2,10.6251/BEP.202012_52(2).0010,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111354698&doi=10.6251%2fBEP.202012_52%282%29.0010&partnerID=40&md5=6385f554f97df638491b23af99fd3bb2,"Phonological recoding is a psychological process in which readers convert printed words into sounds (i.e., phonological codes) during silent reading. The role of phonological recoding in reading has long been debated in the field of psycholinguistics. Most relevant studies have mainly focused on examining the role of phonological recoding in word recognition. Three major theoretical approaches have been proposed for lexical access. First, the phonological mediation model assumes that the meaning of a word is accessed through its phonology; that is, the sequence of the word recognition process is orthography phonology semantics. Phonological recoding of a word occurs prior to the access of its meaning (Lukatela & Turvey, 1994; Rayner, Pollatsek, & Binder, 1998; Van Orden, Johnston, & Hale, 1988). Second, the direct access route model assumes that the meaning of a word can be directly accessed through the transition from orthography to semantics without the mediation of phonology (M. Coltheart & Coltheart, 1997; Taft & Van Graan, 1998). The model, however, does not deny the possibility of phonological activation. Rather, it assumes that phonological recoding occurs concurrently to or later than the access of the word’s meaning. Third, the dual route model suggests that two parallel running routes can achieve lexical access: one is the phonologically mediated route, and the other is the direct access route (M. Coltheart, 2000). The route that achieves lexical access depends on the route that runs the fastest (Barron, 1986; Paap, Noel, & Johansen, 1992). McCusker, Hillinger, and Bias (1981) indicated that the difficulty of material, subjects’ reading fluency, the frequency of occurrence of items, and task demands can determine the use of phonological recoding. Chinese is a logographic language and is also regarded as a phonologically opaque one. Nevertheless, studies investigating the time course of phonological activation in Chinese word recognition have yielded inconsistent results. Although some evidence has suggested that phonology can be activated very early in the word recognition process when Chinese readers read Chinese words or sentences (Guo, Peng, & Liu, 2005; Tan, Hoosain, & Peng, 1995; Zhang & Perfetti, 1993), it remains controversial whether phonological recoding plays a crucial role in word recognition and text comprehension. Few studies have measured Chinese subjects’ reading comprehension under the condition of articulatory suppression, which has been proven to interfere with phonological recoding (Lu & Zhang, 2007; Ding & Wang, 2006). However, the results of such studies have been inconsistent, and whether phonological recoding is important for Chinese text comprehension remains unclear. This study conducted two eye-tracking experiments by using the same experimental paradigm implemented by Guan (2015, 2020) to investigate whether adult Chinese readers need to rely on phonological recoding to understand short expository texts and also whether readers without the background knowledge relevant to domain-specific texts must rely more on phonological recoding to comprehend them. In Experiment 1, 30 university students in Taipei were recruited whose mother tongue was Mandarin Chinese. They were asked to read 20 short expository texts (each one was 350 characters in length) under five different reading conditions: articulatory suppression, reading aloud, concurrent reading and listening to an irrelevant text (IRS), reading while listening to the same text (RWL), and silent reading. The topics of the texts included, for example, “advice for new graduates when entering workforce,” “the impact of 3C products on human cognition,” “water pollution,” “the color of eggs,” “the crisis of water resources,” “the function of sun light,” “the philosopher and the frog,” “Mr. thought,” “experiment with monkeys,” “the stereotypes of teachers in Taiwan,” and “the influences of watching TV on small children.” Subjects’ reading time and comprehension score for each text as well as their eye movements were recorded, which were then analyzed by several linear or generalized linear mixed models to find the best fitting model for each dependent variable. The results revealed that articulatory suppression significantly impaired reading comprehension and caused a larger regression ratio in text reading as well as a higher rereading rate on target words, whereas the effects of the other reading conditions on comprehension did not differ from each other. These results suggest that phonological recoding is essential for Chinese expository text comprehension and word recognition. Reading aloud, compared with silent reading, significantly increased the overall reading time, mean fixation duration, and number of fixations in a text but substantially reduced the mean saccade length and regression ratio. In word-level processing, reading aloud led to a much longer first fixation duration, gaze duration, rereading time, and total reading time on target words selected in the texts. Through word-by-word reading, reading aloud seemed to facilitate integrated sentence meaning, but it failed to significantly enhance overall reading comprehension. Moreover, RWL caused higher rereading rates on target words than did silent reading, and it did not improve reading comprehension. In line with results found under the reading aloud condition, the null effects of reading aloud and RWL on reading comprehension could indicate that both reading conditions make the covert phonological recoding during silent reading overt and therefore imposed similar effects on reading comprehension to those exerted by the phonological recoding in silent reading. Experiment 2 was conducted to further examine whether subjects’ background knowledge regarding the text content would moderate their reliance on phonological recoding in understanding domain-specific texts, such that subjects without much background knowledge would rely more on phonological recoding in the processing of unfamiliar terms and text content. To this end, 15 excerpts from journal articles in Scientific American were used as experimental materials. The topics of these texts were all about physics, such as the Higgs boson, quantum computing, loop quantum gravity, antimatter, charge-coupled devices, and 3He superfluid. The same experimental paradigm as in Experiment 1 was used in Experiment 2, and a different sample of 30 university students in Taipei were recruited as participants. Half majored in humanities and social sciences and had no background knowledge in physics. The other half of the students majored in natural sciences, such as physics, atmospheric physics, and materials science; therefore, they had background knowledge in physics. Participants were asked to read the texts and answer four comprehension questions after reading each text. The results revealed that only background knowledge had a significant effect on reading comprehension, whereas reading conditions and their interaction with background knowledge did not exhibit any significant effects. Participants with relevant background knowledge performed significantly better than did their counterparts. However, background knowledge did not moderate participants’ dependency on phonological recoding in reading comprehension. It seems that phonological recoding did not play a crucial role in understanding short domain-specific texts. Analysis of participants’ eye movements indicated that reading aloud could slow their reading speed and reduce their regression ratio, but it did not enhance reading comprehension. RWL increased the rereading rate on target words in short expository texts, and it increased reading time and the mean fixation duration in domain specific texts. IRS did not affect comprehension performance; it only increased the rereading rate on domain-specific target words and prolonged the first fixation duration for participants without relevant background knowledge. In sum, the results of this study suggest that phonological recoding provides critical support for Chinese adult readers to comprehend short expository texts, but it only plays a minor role in understanding domain-specific texts. When participants read domain-specific texts, it was their background knowledge that dominated their reading comprehension performance. © 2020, National Taiwan Normal University.

Variational methods that use quantum resources of imperfect quantum devices with the help of classical computing techniques are popular for supervised learning. Variational Quantum Classification (VQC) is one of such variational methods with possible quantum advantage in using quantum-enhanced features that are hard to compute by classical methods. Its performance depends on the mapping of classical features into quantum-enhanced feature space. Although there have been many quantum-mapping functions proposed so far, there is little discussion on efficient mapping of discrete features, such as, race, gender, marriage status and others that are often significant for classifying datasets of interest. We first introduce the use of Quantum Random Access Coding (QRAC) to map such discrete features efficiently into limited number of qubits for VQC. We numerically show that QRAC can help speeding up the training of VQC by reducing its parameters via reduction on the number of qubits for the mapping. We confirm the effectiveness of the QRAC in VQC by experimenting on classification of healthcare datasets with both simulators and real quantum devices. © 2020 IEEE.",discrete features; quantum machine learning; quantum random access coding; supervised learning; variational quantum algorithms,Learning systems; Mapping; Quantum theory; Qubits; Signal encoding; Variational techniques; Classical computing; Classical methods; Feature space; Mapping functions; Quantum device; Quantum resources; Random access; Variational methods; Classification (of information),"2020 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2020",Conference paper

This ability has originated the quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEAs), which are classical algorithms (for classical computers) that exploit quantum mechanics principles to improve their performance. Several proposed QIEAs are able to outperform their traditional counterparts when applied to different kinds of problems. Aiming to exploit this new paradigm on genetic programming (GP), this paper introduces a novel QIEA model (quantum-inspired linear GP-QuaLiGP), which evolves machine code programs. QuaLiGP is inspired on multi-level quantum systems, and its operation is based on quantum individuals, which represent a superposition of all programs (solutions) of the search space. The tests use symbolic regression and binary classification as knowledge management problems to assess the QuaLiGP performance and compare it with Automatic Induction of Machine Code by Genetic Programming model, which is currently the most efficient GP model to evolve machine code. Results show that QuaLiGP outperforms the reference GP system for all these problems, by achieving better solutions from a smaller number of evaluations and by using fewer parameters and operators. This paper concludes that the quantum-inspired paradigm can be a competitive approach to evolve programs efficiently, encouraging improvements and extensions of QuaLiGP. © 2013 The Author.",binary classification; evolutionary computation; genetic programming; quantum-inspired algorithms; symbolic regression,Evolutionary algorithms; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Automatic induction; Binary classification; Genetic programming modeling; Knowledge management system; Linear genetic programming; Machine code programs; Quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm; Symbolic regression; Genetic programming,,Article

However, due to various user's habits, the discharging profiles of the lithium-ion battery are totally different in practice, thereby limiting applications of many feature-based methods in real operations. Compared with the discharging process, the charging process is usually executed in a more peaceable and predictable manner. Therefore, two time-related aging features are extracted from the constant current-constant voltage charging process in this work. By introducing the quantum computing theory into the classical intelligent learning model, an improved Gaussian process regression framework, as well as its application to describe relations between extracted features and the battery SOH, is proposed and illustrated in detail. With datasets of lithium-ion batteries by NASA, experiment and comparison results validate the effectiveness, accuracy and superiority of the presented online SOH estimation framework. © 2019 IEEE.",Gaussian process regression; Lithium-ion battery; Quantum particle swarm optimization; State of health,Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Computation theory; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Health; Ions; Maintainability; NASA; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Regression analysis; Reliability; Comparison result; Discharging process; Feature-based method; Gaussian process regression; Intelligent learning; Quantum Computing; Quantum particle swarm optimization; State of health; Lithium-ion batteries,"2019 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium, RAMS 2019",Conference paper

It generates initial parents using quantum seeds. It is here that QSHECT incorporates ideas from the principles of quantum computation and integrates them in the current framework of Real Coded Evolutionary Algorithm (RCEA). It also incorporates Simulated Annealing (SA) in the selection process of Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) for child generation. The proposed algorithm has been tested on standard test problems and engineering design problems taken from the literature. In order to test this algorithm on domain-specific manufacturing problems, Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) modeling of hot extrusion is attempted and the NF model is incorporated as a fitness evaluator inside the QSHECT to form a new variant of this technique, i.e. Quantum Seeded Neuro Fuzzy Hybrid Evolutionary Computational Technique (QSNFHECT) and is effectively applied for process optimization of hot extrusion process. The neuro-fuzzy model (NF) is also compared with statistical regression analysis (RA) model for evaluating the extrusion load. The NF model was found to be much superior. The optimal process parameters obtained by Quantum Seeded Neuro Fuzzy Hybrid Evolutionary Technique (QSNFHECT) are validated by the finite element model. The proposed methodology using QSNFHECT is a step towards meeting the challenges posed in intelligent manufacturing systems and opens new avenues for parameter estimation and optimization and can be easily incorporated in existing manufacturing setup. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",FEM; NF modeling; QSHECT; QSNFHECT,Algorithms; Constrained optimization; Extrusion; Extrusion dies; Finite element method; Fuzzy inference; Manufacture; Optimization; Quantum computers; Regression analysis; Simulated annealing; Constrained optimi-zation problems; Engineering design problems; Estimation and optimization; Evolutionary techniques; Intelligent manufacturing system; QSHECT; QSNFHECT; Statistical regression analysis; Evolutionary algorithms,,Article

A reliable prediction of toxic effects of chemicals in living systems is highly desirable in domains such as cosmetics, drug design, food safety, and manufacturing chemical compounds. Toxicity prediction topic requires several new approaches for knowledge discovery from data to paradigm composite associations between the modules of the chemical compound; such techniques need more computational cost as the number of chemical compounds increases. State-of-the-art prediction methods such as neural network and multi-layer regression that requires either tuning parameters or complex transformations of predictor or outcome variables are not achieving high accuracy results. This paper proposes a Quantum Inspired Genetic Programming “QIGP” model to improve the prediction accuracy. Genetic Programming is utilized to give a linear equation for calculating toxicity degree more accurately. Quantum computing is employed to improve the selection of the best-of-run individuals and handles parsimony pressure to reduce the complexity of the solutions. The results of the internal validation analysis indicated that the QIGP model has the better goodness of fit statistics and significantly outperforms the Neural Network model. © 2017 International Journal of Artificial Intelegence Research.

Resulting machine learning models of quantum properties, a.k.a. quantum machine learning models exhibit improved training efficiency and result in smoother predictions of energies related to molecular distortions. We first illustrate smoothness for the continuous extraction of an atom from some organic molecule. Learning curves, quantifying the decay of the atomization energy's prediction error as a function of training set size, have been obtained for tens of thousands of organic molecules drawn from the QM9 data set. In comparison to conventionally used metrics (L1and L2norm), our numerical results indicate systematic improvement in terms of learning curve off-set for random as well as sorted (by norms of row) atom indexing in Coulomb matrices. Our findings suggest that this metric corresponds to a favorable similarity measure which introduces index-invariance in any kernel based model relying on adjacency matrix representations. © 2020 IOP.

To solve the abovementioned characteristics of a MEL time series, the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVR) hybridizing with meta-heuristic algorithms is applied to simulate the nonlinear system of a MEL time series. As it is known that the fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) has several embedded drawbacks that lead to problems, this paper applies a quantum computing mechanism (QCM) to empower each fruit fly to possess quantum behavior during the searching processes, i.e., a QFOA algorithm. Eventually, the cat chaotic mapping function is introduced into the QFOA algorithm, namely CQFOA, to implement the chaotic global perturbation strategy to help fruit flies to escape from the local optima while the population's diversity is poor. Finally, a new MEL forecasting method, namely the LS-SVR-CQFOA model, is established by hybridizing the LS-SVR model with CQFOA. The experimental results illustrate that, in three datasets, the proposed LS-SVR-CQFOA model is superior to other alternative models, including BPNN (back-propagation neural networks), LS-SVR-CQPSO (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm), LS-SVR-CQTS (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum tabu search algorithm), LS-SVR-CQGA (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum genetic algorithm), LS-SVR-CQBA (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum bat algorithm), LS-SVR-FOA, and LS-SVR-QFOA models, in terms of forecasting accuracy indexes. In addition, it passes the significance test at a 97.5% confidence level. © 2018 by the authors.

It encodes the cost function using a p-level quantum circuit where each level consists a problem Hamiltonian followed by a mixing Hamiltonian. Despite the promises, few real-world applications (besides the pedagogical MaxCut problem) have exploited QAOA. The success of QAOA relies on the classical optimizer, variational parameter setting, and quantum circuit design and compilation. In this study, we implement QAOA and analyze its performance for a broader Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation to solve real-word applications such as, partially occluded object detection problem. Furthermore, we analyze the effects of above influential factors on QAOA performance. We propose a 3-level improvement of hybrid quantum-classical optimization for object detection. We achieve more than 13X execution speedup by choosing L-BFGS-B as classical optimizer at the first level and 5.50X additional speedup by exploiting parameter symmetry and more than 1.23X acceleration using parameter regression at the second level. We empirically show that the circuit will achieve better fidelity by optimally rescheduling gate operations (especially for deeper circuits) at the third level. © 2020 IEEE.",Object Detection; QAOA; Quantum Computing; QUBO,Combinatorial optimization; Cost functions; Hamiltonians; Integrated circuit manufacture; Object detection; Object recognition; Approximate optimization; Approximate solution; Combinatorial optimization problems; Influential factors; Parameter regressions; Partially occluded objects; Quantum circuit design; Variational parameters; Optimization,"21st International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design, ISQED 2020",Conference paper
