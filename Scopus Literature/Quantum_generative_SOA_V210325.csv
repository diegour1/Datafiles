Shah S.R.K.; Vatsa M.,Enhancing Quantum Diffusion Models with Pairwise Bell State Entanglement,2025,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics) ,0,https://scopus.unalproxy.elogim.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211800242&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-78395-1_23&partnerID=40&md5=eee7ef11284d15fdacbc7d9beb99f080," This paper introduces a novel quantum diffusion model designed for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Unlike previous methods, this model efficiently processes higher-dimensional images with complex pixel structures, even on qubit-limited platforms. This is accomplished through a pairwise Bell-state entangling technique, which reduces space complexity. Additionally, parameterized quantum circuits enable the generation of quantum states with minimal parameters, while still delivering high performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments, comparing the proposed model with both classical and quantum techniques using datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. The results show significant improvements in computational efficiency and performance metrics such as FID, SSIM and PSNR. By leveraging quantum entanglement and superposition, this approach advances quantum generative learning. This advancement paves the way for more sophisticated and resource-efficient quantum diffusion algorithms capable of handling complex data on the NISQ devices. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",10.1007/978-3-031-78395-1_23,"Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Jodhpur, India","Shah S.R.K., Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Jodhpur, India; Vatsa M., Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Jodhpur, India",Diffusion Models; Quantum Entanglement.; Quantum Machine Learning,Network security; Quantum computers; Quantum efficiency; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Bell state; Diffusion model; High-dimensional images; Machine-learning; Pixel structure; Quantum device; Quantum diffusion; Quantum entanglement.; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum entanglement,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,"27th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, ICPR 2024",1 December 2024 through 5 December 2024,Kolkata,Conference paper,

Advances in generative AI techniques, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and quantum variational classifiers (QVCs), offer promising tools for predicting gene associations between drugs and diseases. This study aims to compare the predictive performance of VAEs and QVCs in modeling drug-disease gene networks within the Wnt signaling pathway in periodontal inflammation. Methods: Genes associated with Wnt-related periodontal inflammation were identified through comprehensive literature reviews and genomic databases. Their roles in various biological processes were evaluated using gene set enrichment analysis, employing tools like Enrichr, which integrates diverse gene sets from sources such as DSigDB, DisGeNET, and Lincs_l1000.drug. The study then applied VAEs and QVCs to predict gene-disease associations related to the Wnt signaling pathway. Results: The analysis revealed an extensive network comprising 1738 nodes and 1498 edges, averaging 1.992 neighbors per node. The network exhibited a diameter of 2, a radius of 1, and a characteristic path length of 1.992, indicating limited interconnectivity. The VQA model demonstrated a high accuracy rate of 97.5%, although it only detected 50% of anomalies. The VQC model achieved a precision of 78%, with Class 1 samples showing improved recall and a balanced F1 score. Conclusion: VQC and VAE models exhibit strong potential for discovering FDA-approved drugs by predicting gene-drug associations in periodontitis based on the Wnt signaling pathway. Clinical Relevance: This study highlights the potential of VAEs and QVCs in predicting gene-drug associations for periodontal inflammation. This could lead to more targeted therapies for oral diseases like periodontitis, improving patient outcomes and advancing personalized treatment strategies in clinical practice. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.identj.2024.09.025,"Department of Periodontics, Saveetha Dental College and Hospital, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Saveetha University, Tamil Nadu, Chennai, 600077, India; Department of Clinical Sciences, Center of Medical and Bio-allied Health Sciences and Research, College of Dentistry, Ajman University, Ajman, United Arab Emirates; Restorative Dentistry, College of Dentistry.

There are four key methodologies that have been proposed in this work: Quantum Support Vector Machines with Enhanced Feature Extraction, Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks for Data Augmentation, Quantum Entanglement and Correlation Analysis for Feature Detection, and Quantum-Enhanced Image Reconstruction for Noisy Data Samples. Q-SVM-EFE is a Quantum Support Vector Machine-based framework that incorporates advanced feature extraction to map classical image data into high-dimensional quantum states, which should capture intricate patterns and therefore be more accurate for classification. This approach scored more than 95 percent in terms of classification accuracy and tenfold increased the speed of training compared to classical SVMs. QGAN-DA generates high-quality synthetic images to alleviate the scarcity of labeled medical data. It trains a generator network through quantum circuits for the generation of new samples and a discriminator network for real image and sample classification, thus ensuring high diversity and quality in synthetic data with SSIM values above 0.90. QECA-FD applies quantum entanglement in the analysis of biomedical image correlations and is therefore very effective in detecting subtle features and anomalies. This resulted in over 95% sensitivity in anomaly detection and increased the speed of the correlation analysis by five times. QIR-ND enables enhanced image reconstruction from sullied or incomplete data through quantum noise reduction and reconstruction techniques. This new approach gave a PSNR greater than 40 dB and an eightfold improvement in reconstruction delays.  © 2013 IEEE.",10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3531407,"VIT-AP University, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Andhra Pradesh, Amaravati, 522237, India; Srinivas University, Unit Head of IoT and Robotics and AI, AR&VR Departments, Institute of Engineering and Technology, Mangaluru, 574146, India; Vignan's Foundation for Science, Technology and Research, Department of Advanced Computer Science and Engineering, Andhra Pradesh, Vadlamudi, 522213, India; Kallam Haranadhareddy Institute of Technology, Department of CSE, Andhra Pradesh, Guntur, 522019, India","Kumari Pappala L., VIT-AP University, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Andhra Pradesh, Amaravati, 522237, India; Babu Veesam S., VIT-AP University, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Andhra Pradesh, Amaravati, 522237, India; Chattu K., VIT-AP University, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Andhra Pradesh, Amaravati, 522237, India; Venkata Krishna J., Srinivas University, Unit Head of IoT and Robotics and AI, AR&VR Departments, Institute of Engineering and Technology, Mangaluru, 574146, India; Devi Bodapati J., Vignan's Foundation for Science, Technology and Research, Department of Advanced Computer Science and Engineering, Andhra Pradesh, Vadlamudi, 522213, India; Rao B., Kallam Haranadhareddy Institute of Technology, Department of CSE, Andhra Pradesh, Guntur, 522019, India",Biomedical imaging; generative adversarial networks; image reconstruction; quantum computing; support vector machines,Anomaly detection; Image correlation; Image enhancement; Image reconstruction; Labeled data; Medical image processing; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Reinforcement learning; Support vector machines; Adversarial networks; Biomedical images; Biomedical imaging; Correlation analysis; Features extraction; Images reconstruction; Iterative model; Quantum Computing; Quantum image processing; Support vectors machine; Quantum entanglement,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

It is similar to deer-vehicle collisions in the United States and kangaroo-vehicle collisions in Australia. When it comes to road accidents, each millisecond of early warning/detection matters, potentially transforming a life-threatening situation into a manageable incident. Therefore, this study aims to mitigate CVCs by integrating quantum computing and Generative Pretrained Transformer-4Omni (GPT-4o) into autonomous vehicles (AVs). Environmental data was sourced through high-accuracy sensors in conjunction with quantum algorithms and GPT-4o modules handling the processing through a multi-phase approach. The integration allowed for enhanced detection, tracking, and decision-making regarding camel movements. Heatmaps revealed heightened camel activity during low-visibility nighttime conditions and seasonal peaks, particularly during the breeding season. The quantum-enhanced algorithms achieved a mean detection accuracy of 95% and tracking precision of 92%, with computational speeds 10x that of classical methods. GPT-4o vision modules further improved object detection accuracy to 98.7%, securing (ʈ=0.97) seconds as an early warning to the AV's braking system. This innovative approach offers a novel paradigm in AV technology, setting new standards for safety and efficiency in transportation. Future GPT-5 models can be used in AVs and with sophisticated technologies for safer driving and wildlife protection. The results obtained from this study go beyond updating AV safety technology, opening avenues for application in urban planning and real-time hazard detection systems. © 2025 Tongji University and Tongji University Press",10.1016/j.ijtst.2025.02.002,"IDentity Research, Amman, Jordan","Abaddi S., IDentity Research, Amman, Jordan",Autonomous vehicles; Camel-vehicle collisions; GPT-4o; Quantum computing; Transportation science,Highway accidents; Network security; Quantum electronics; Qubits; Urban transportation; Autonomous Vehicles; Camel-vehicle collision; Detection accuracy; Early warning; Generative pretrained transformer-4omni; Public safety; Quantum Computing; Safety hazards; Transportation science; Vehicles collision; Autonomous vehicles,KeAi Communications Co.,,,,,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

The 6G technology aims to enhance existing usage scenarios by supporting innovative applications that require stringent key performance indicators (KPIs). In some critical use cases of 6G, multiple KPIs, including immersive throughput, with an envisioned peak data rate of 1 Tb/s, hyperreliability, in the range of 10-5 to 10-7, and hyperlow latency, between 0.1 and 1 ms, must be achieved simultaneously to deliver the expected service experience. However, this is challenging because of the conflicting nature of these KPIs. This article proposes a new service class of 6G as immersive, hyperreliable, and low-latency communications and introduces a potential network architecture to achieve the associated KPIs. Specifically, enhanced technologies, such as ultramassive multiple-input, multiple-output-aided terahertz communications, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and nonterrestrial networks, are viewed as the key enablers for achieving immersive data rates and hyperreliability. Given the computational complexity involved in employing these technologies, we propose mathematical and computational enabling technologies, such as learning to optimize, generative artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and network digital twins, to complement the proposed architecture and optimize the latency. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/MVT.2025.3531346,"Carleton University, Systems and Computer Engineering Department, Ottawa, K1S 5B6, ON, Canada; Ohio University, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Athens, 45701, OH, United States; The American University Cairo, Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Cairo, 11835, Egypt; Carleton University, Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Ottawa, K1S 5B6, ON, Canada","Shamsabadi A.A., Carleton University, Systems and Computer Engineering Department, Ottawa, K1S 5B6, ON, Canada; Yadav A., Ohio University, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Athens, 45701, OH, United States; Gadallah Y., The American University Cairo, Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Cairo, 11835, Egypt; Yanikomeroglu H., Carleton University, Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Ottawa, K1S 5B6, ON, Canada",,Data-rate; Immersive; Industry stakeholders; Key performance indicators; Low-latency communication; Multiple keys; Stringents; Telecommunications networks; Usage scenarios; Wireless telecommunications,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,,Article,All Open Access; Green Open Access

This leads to explainable AI (XAI) manifesting itself as an important research field that helps humans to better comprehend ML systems. In parallel, quantum machine learning (QML) is emerging with the ongoing improvement of quantum computing hardware combined with its increasing availability via cloud services. QML enables quantum-enhanced ML in which quantum mechanics is exploited to facilitate ML tasks, typically in the form of quantum-classical hybrid algorithms that combine quantum and classical resources. Quantum gates constitute the building blocks of gate-based quantum hardware and form circuits that can be used for quantum computations. For QML applications, quantum circuits are typically parameterized and their parameters are optimized classically such that a suitably defined objective function is minimized. Inspired by XAI, we raise the question of the explainability of such circuits by quantifying the importance of (groups of) gates for specific goals. To this end, we apply the well-established concept of Shapley values. The resulting attributions can be interpreted as explanations for why a specific circuit works well for a given task, improving the understanding of how to construct parameterized (or variational) quantum circuits, and fostering their human interpretability in general. An experimental evaluation on simulators and two superconducting quantum hardware devices demonstrates the benefits of the proposed framework for classification, generative modeling, transpilation, and optimization. Furthermore, our results shed some light on the role of specific gates in popular QML approaches. © The Author(s) 2025.",10.1007/s42484-025-00254-8,"Fraunhofer ITWM, Fraunhofer-Platz 1, Kaiserslautern, 67663, Germany; Fraunhofer IAIS, Schloss Birlinghoven 1, Sankt Augustin, 53757, Germany; TU Dortmund, August-Schmidt-Straße 1, Dortmund, 44227, Germany","Heese R., Fraunhofer ITWM, Fraunhofer-Platz 1, Kaiserslautern, 67663, Germany; Gerlach T., Fraunhofer IAIS, Schloss Birlinghoven 1, Sankt Augustin, 53757, Germany; Mücke S., TU Dortmund, August-Schmidt-Straße 1, Dortmund, 44227, Germany; Müller S., Fraunhofer ITWM, Fraunhofer-Platz 1, Kaiserslautern, 67663, Germany; Jakobs M., TU Dortmund, August-Schmidt-Straße 1, Dortmund, 44227, Germany; Piatkowski N., Fraunhofer IAIS, Schloss Birlinghoven 1, Sankt Augustin, 53757, Germany",Explainable machine learning; Quantum machine learning; Shapley values,Adversarial machine learning; Machine learning; Photons; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Explainable machine learning; Machine learning systems; Machine-learning; Parameterized; Quantum circuit; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Research fields; Shapley value; Quantum computers,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,,,Article,

However, its recent evolution, engineered by technological transformation, big data analytics, and quantum computing, produces conversational and generative AI (CGAI/GenAI) and human-like chatbots that disrupt conventional operations and methods in different fields. This study investigates the scientific landscape of CGAI and human–chatbot interaction/collaboration and evaluates use cases, benefits, challenges, and policy implications for multidisciplinary education and allied industry operations. The publications trend showed that just 4% (n = 75) occurred during 2006–2018, while 2019–2023 experienced astronomical growth (n = 1763 or 96%). The prominent use cases of CGAI (e.g., ChatGPT) for teaching, learning, and research activities occurred in computer science (multidisciplinary and AI; 32%), medical/healthcare (17%), engineering (7%), and business fields (6%). The intellectual structure shows strong collaboration among eminent multidisciplinary sources in business, information systems, and other areas. The thematic structure highlights prominent CGAI use cases, including improved user experience in human–computer interaction, computer programs/code generation, and systems creation. Widespread CGAI usefulness for teachers, researchers, and learners includes syllabi/course content generation, testing aids, and academic writing. The concerns about abuse and misuse (plagiarism, academic integrity, privacy violations) and issues about misinformation, danger of self-diagnoses, and patient privacy in medical/healthcare applications are prominent. Formulating strategies and policies to address potential CGAI challenges in teaching/learning and practice are priorities. Developing discipline-based automatic detection of GenAI contents to check abuse is proposed. In operational/operations research areas, proper CGAI/GenAI integration with modeling and decision support systems requires further studies. © 2024 The Author(s).

A variational quantum classifier (VQC) using ultrasonic phased arrays is proposed to extract weld defect features in the atomic state to improve the classification accuracy and achieve high-speed calculation due to simultaneous qubits. The VQC is trained using a simulation-assisted weld dataset generated using finite element (FE) models and deep convolution generative adversarial networks (DCGAN). The total focusing method (TFM) weld images of porosity and slag are generated using time-transmitted signals received by performing full matrix capture, modeling various defect morphologies using FE simulations. These datasets are fed to train the DCGAN to generate synthetic TFM images. We use the feature selection method to obtain the best results with a quantum circuit with minimal qubits. Prominent features so obtained are supplied to the encoder circuit of the VQC to convert it to a quantum domain, thereby passing to an ansatz circuit to train quantum hyperparameters. The loss is computed for every iteration by optimizing the learnable parameters of the VQC. The VQC is trained by varying quantities of datasets to improve the reliability and efficiency of the weld defect classifications.

This framework uniquely integrates data augmentation, clustering, and quantum machine learning (QML). Firstly, considering the problem of insufficient data under extreme weather fluctuation patterns, the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) incorporating bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layers is adopted for data expansion. Introducing BiLSTM network layers enhances its ability to capture long-term sequence dependencies. Secondly, a two-stage clustering method is specifically designed to classify weather fluctuation patterns accurately. On this basis, a hybrid quantum–classical prediction model is constructed by combining Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to compensate for the shortcomings of traditional methods in feature mining. In addition, this article introduces a new evaluation metric: the Improved Weighted Mean Absolute Percentage Error (WMAPE-β), which is used to measure model performance more comprehensively. The comparative experiments indicate that the proposed model outperforms BiLSTM, LSTM, DLinear, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Convolutional Neural Network-Gated Recurrent Unit (CNN-GRU), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) models in terms of prediction accuracy, convergence speed, stability, and generalization capability. Under different weather fluctuation patterns, the average R2 values of the proposed model are 0.998, 0.993, and 0.984, respectively. This study provides a new reference direction for accurate prediction of distributed PV power, which is of great significance for optimizing grid integration and energy management in renewable energy systems. © 2025",10.1016/j.compeleceng.2025.110122,"Institute of Advanced Technology for Carbon Neutrality, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210023, China; College of Automation & Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210023, China; State Grid Smart Grid Research Institute Co., Ltd, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210003, China; Weifang Hongrun New Materials Co., Ltd, Shandong, Weifang, 262737, China","Zhu W., Institute of Advanced Technology for Carbon Neutrality, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210023, China, College of Automation & Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210023, China; Li H., Institute of Advanced Technology for Carbon Neutrality, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210023, China, College of Automation & Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210023, China; Bu X., State Grid Smart Grid Research Institute Co., Ltd, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210003, China; Xu L., Institute of Advanced Technology for Carbon Neutrality, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210023, China, College of Automation & Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210023, China; Jiu A., Weifang Hongrun New Materials Co., Ltd, Shandong, Weifang, 262737, China; Dou C., Institute of Advanced Technology for Carbon Neutrality, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210023, China",Dynamic time warping; Generative adversarial network; Quantum machine learning; Ultra-short-term distributed PV power prediction; Variational quantum circuit,Adversarial machine learning; Cluster analysis; Energy management; Fermions; Generative adversarial networks; Long short-term memory; Multilayer neural networks; Particle beams; Photons; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Variational techniques; Weather forecasting; Adversarial networks; Dynamic time warping; Machine-learning; Photovoltaic power; Power predictions; Quantum circuit; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Ultra-short-term distributed photovoltaic power prediction; Variational quantum circuit; Convolutional neural networks,Elsevier Ltd,,,,,Article,

In this study, we focus on deep energy-based models (EBM), as they require continuous-domain Gibbs sampling both during training and inference. In lieu of fault-tolerant quantum computers that can execute quantum Gibbs sampling algorithms, we use the Monte Carlo simulation of diffusion processes as a classical alternative. More specifically, we investigate whether long-run persistent chain Monte Carlo simulation of Langevin dynamics improves the quality of the representations achieved by EBMs. We consider a scheme in which the Monte Carlo simulation of a diffusion, whose drift is given by the gradient of the energy function, is used to improve the adversarial robustness and calibration score of an independent classifier network. Our results show that increasing the computational budget of Gibbs sampling in persistent contrastive divergence improves both the calibration and adversarial robustness of the model, suggesting a prospective avenue of quantum advantage for generative AI using future large-scale quantum computers. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",10.1007/s42484-025-00256-6,"Department of Physics & Astronomy, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, 37996-1200, TN, United States; Institute for Quantum Computing, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, N2L 3G1, ON, Canada; Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, N2L 3G1, ON, Canada; Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Waterloo, N2L 2Y5, ON, Canada; 1QB Information Technologies (1QBit), Vancouver, V6E 4B1, BC, Canada; Computer & Information Sciences Directorate, Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, 21005-5069, MD, United States; Department of Mathematics, University of Maryland, College Park, 20742-4015, MD, United States","Crum N.A., Department of Physics & Astronomy, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, 37996-1200, TN, United States; Sunny L., Department of Physics & Astronomy, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, 37996-1200, TN, United States; Ronagh P., Institute for Quantum Computing, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, N2L 3G1, ON, Canada, Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, N2L 3G1, ON, Canada, Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Waterloo, N2L 2Y5, ON, Canada, 1QB Information Technologies (1QBit), Vancouver, V6E 4B1, BC, Canada; Laflamme R., Institute for Quantum Computing, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, N2L 3G1, ON, Canada, Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, N2L 3G1, ON, Canada, Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Waterloo, N2L 2Y5, ON, Canada; Balu R., Computer & Information Sciences Directorate, Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, 21005-5069, MD, United States, Department of Mathematics, University of Maryland, College Park, 20742-4015, MD, United States; Siopsis G., Department of Physics & Astronomy, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, 37996-1200, TN, United States",Adversarial attacks; Diffusion processes; Energy-based models; Generative modeling; Quantum Gibbs sampling; Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics; Stochastic security,Adversarial machine learning; Budget control; Fault tolerant computer systems; Generative adversarial networks; Monte Carlo methods; Photons; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Diffusion process; Energy-based models; Generative model; Gibbs sampling; Langevin dynamics; Quantum gibbs sampling; Stochastic gradient; Stochastic gradient langevin dynamic; Stochastic security; Stochastics; Quantum computers,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,,,Article,All Open Access; Green Open Access

However, another emerging paradigm represents an image as a Quantum Implicit Neural Representation (QINR). In this work, we propose a novel architectural technique for building QINR-based QGAN to enhance the quality of images generated by QGANs. Additionally, we integrate classical techniques, such as Gradient Penalty and Wasserstein distance, to train QINR-QGAN. In image generation tasks, we demonstrated that QINR-QGAN can achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models while significantly reducing the number of trainable quantum parameters. Specifically, QINR-QGAN reduced the trainable quantum parameters by nearly 10 times compared to PQWGAN (Tsang et al. in IEEE Trans. Quantum Eng. 4:1–19, 2023) and Quantum AnoGAN (Herr et al. Quantum Sci. Technol. 6(4): 045004, 2021), demonstrating its superior efficiency in parameter optimization without sacrificing performance. Furthermore, we conducted experiments on the CelebA dataset to tackle a more complex task and generate larger images (78×64).

Combining GANs and quantum computing, quantum GANs are thought to have an exponential advantage over their classical counterparts due to the stronger expressibility of quantum circuits. In this research, a two-qubit silicon quantum photonic chip is created, capable of executing arbitrary controlled-unitary ((Formula presented.)) operations and generating any two-qubit pure state, thus making it an excellent platform for quantum GANs. To capture complex data patterns, a hybrid generator is proposed to inject nonlinearity into quantum GANs. As a demonstration, three generative tasks, covering both pure quantum versions of GANs (PQ-GANs) and hybrid quantum-classical GANs (HQC-GANs), are successfully carried out on the chip, including high-fidelity single-qubit state learning, classical distributions loading, and compressed image production.

Recent studies have revealed that, like their classical counterparts, QML models based on Parametrized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Moreover, the existence of Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) in the quantum domain has been demonstrated theoretically in the context of quantum classifiers. In this work, we introduce QuGAP: a novel framework for generating UAPs for quantum classifiers. We conceptualize the notion of additive UAPs for PQC-based classifiers and theoretically demonstrate their existence. We then utilize generative models (QuGAP-A) to craft additive UAPs and experimentally show that quantum classifiers are susceptible to such attacks. Moreover, we formulate a new method for generating unitary UAPs (QuGAP-U) using quantum generative models and a novel loss function based on fidelity constraints. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art misclassification rates, while maintaining high fidelity between legitimate and adversarial samples.

People cannot comprehend and predict the emotions or expressions of individuals through simple vision. Thus, in psychology, detecting facial expressions or emotion analysis demands an assessment and evaluation of decisions for identifying the emotions of a person or any group during communication. With the recent evolution of technology, AI (Artificial Intelligence) has gained significant usage, wherein DL (Deep Learning) based algorithms are employed for detecting facial expressions. Methods: The study proposes a system design that detects facial expressions by extracting relevant features using a Modified ResNet model. The proposed system stacks building-blocks with residual connections and employs an advanced extraction method with quantum computing, which significantly reduces computation time compared to conventional methods. The backbone stem utilizes a quantum convolutional layer comprised of several parameterized quantum-filters. Additionally, the research integrates residual connections in the ResNet-18 model with the Modified up Sampled Bottle Neck Process (MuS-BNP), retaining computational efficacy while benefiting from residual connections. Results: The proposed model demonstrates superior performance by overcoming the issue of maximum similarity within varied facial expressions. The system’s ability to accurately detect and differentiate between expressions is measured using performance metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, recall, and precision. Discussion: This performance analysis confirms the efficacy of the proposed system, highlighting the advantages of quantum computing in feature extraction and the integration of residual connections. The model achieves quantum superiority, providing faster and more accurate computations compared to existing methodologies. The results suggest that the proposed approach offers a promising solution for facial expression recognition tasks, significantly improving both speed and accuracy.

We demonstrate various approaches to topic classification. The first uses an explicit word-based approach, in which word-topic weights are implemented as fractional rotations of individual qubits, and a phrase is classified based on the accumulation of these weights onto a scoring qubit, using entangling quantum gates. This is compared with more scalable quantum encodings of word embedding vectors, which are used to compute kernel values in a quantum support vector machine: this approach achieved an average of 62% accuracy on classification tasks involving over 10000 words, which is the largest such quantum computing experiment to date. We describe a quantum probability approach to bigram modeling that can be applied to understand sequences of words and formal concepts, investigate a generative approximation to these distributions using a quantum circuit Born machine, and introduce an approach to ambiguity resolution in verb-noun composition using single-qubit rotations for simple nouns and 2-qubit entangling gates for simple verbs. The smaller systems presented have been run successfully on physical quantum computers, and the larger ones have been simulated. We show that statistically meaningful results can be obtained, but the quality of individual results varies much more using real datasets than using artificial language examples from previous quantum NLP research.

This work systematically compares a broad range of techniques to guide quantum computing practitioners when deciding which models and methods to use in their applications. We compare fundamentally different architectural ansatzes of parametric quantum circuits: (1) A continuous architecture, which produces continuous-valued data samples, and (2) a discrete architecture, which samples on a discrete grid. We also compare the performance of different data transformations: the min-max and the probability integral transforms. We use two popular training methods: (1) quantum circuit Born machines (QCBM), and (2) quantum generative adversarial networks (QGAN). We study their performance and tradeoffs as the number of model parameters increases, with a baseline comparison of similarly trained classical neural networks. The study is performed on six low-dimensional synthetic and two real financial data sets. Our two key findings are that: (1) For all data sets, our quantum models require similar or fewer parameters than their classical counterparts. In the extreme case, the quantum models require two orders of magnitude less parameters.

Quantum techniques are shown to have a higher robustness advantage and are more resistant to attacks from adversarial examples than classical machine learning. Inspired by the robustness advantage of quantum computing and the feature extraction advantage of convolutional neural networks, this paper proposes a novel variational quantum convolutional neural network model (VQCNN), whose quantum fully connected layer consists of a combination of a quantum filter and a variational quantum neural network to increase the model’s adversarial robustness. The network intrusion detection model based on VQCNN is verified on KDD CUP99 and UNSW-NB datasets. The results show that under the attack of Fast Gradient Sign Method, the decline values of accuracy, precision, and recall rate of the intrusion detection model based on VQCNN are less than those of the other four models, and it has higher adversarial robustness. © The British Computer Society 2024.

More importantly, it analyses the potentially disruptive impact of this ascendant technology on higher education and the global workplace. The findings of this paper indicate that students pursuing higher education tend to perceive GAI favourably, as it frees them from the toil of rote-learning. However, the view is rather mixed in the case of educators, who are still coming to grips with this seemingly disruptive technology. In the case of the global labour market, GAI has the potential to decimate legions of white-collar jobs once it eliminates inherent issues of biases, security and misinformation. Despite the media's constant labelling of GAI as a disruptive technology that has suddenly burst onto the technological scene, it is evidenced in this paper that the technology has taken nearly eight decades to reach today's level of technological advancement.

Generative Adversarial Networks, in particular, have shown immense potential for accelerating the drug discovery pipeline. However, these models consume a significant amount of computational resources, as they must perform adversarial training on expansive datasets to accurately sample the vast chemical space. Aiming for more efficient runtimes and rigorous analyses of high-dimensional molecular data with quantum computing, we previously developed a hybrid quantum-classical generative adversarial network (QGAN) to generate potential small organic drug candidates. Later, inspired by the classical NetGAN, we upgraded QGAN to a hybrid quantum-classical graph generative adversarial network (QNetGAN) which generated graph structures via random walks. This model was more efficient and had a higher accuracy rate (47.0%) than QGAN (2.3%). Most recently, we developed QNetGAN v2, an upgraded version of QNetGAN that features graph convolution. This model was able to generate 273 out of 300 structurally valid molecules that satisfy the octet rule and Lipinski's Rule of Five, yielding an 91.0% success rate and a training time of 35 minutes. This was made possible by integrating several post-processing algorithms into the original QNetGAN model, including the octet rule satisfaction validator, hydrogen addition algorithm, formal charge calculation, and molecular geometry (.XYZ file coordinate) calculation. In the future, we plan to use the QNetGAN v2 pathway to generate molecules with a wider range of elements and add functionality to calculate important molecular properties, ideally developing a third and more capable version of the QNetGAN molecular generation pathway that is able to outperform the accuracy of classical NetGAN. © 2024 IEEE.",10.1109/QCE60285.2024.00183,"University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; Aspiring Scholars Directed Research Program, Fremont, United States; University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States","Cui M., University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; Chang L., Aspiring Scholars Directed Research Program, Fremont, United States; Chau A., University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States; Mekuria H., University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States; Adwankar L., Aspiring Scholars Directed Research Program, Fremont, United States; Pendyala S., Aspiring Scholars Directed Research Program, Fremont, United States; McMahan L., Aspiring Scholars Directed Research Program, Fremont, United States",graph convolution; molecular generation; QNetGAN; Quantum Graph Generative Adversarial Network,Computational geometry; Convolution; Molecular docking; Network theory (graphs); Adversarial networks; Graph convolution; Graph generation; Molecular generation; Molecular graphs; Organics; QNetGAN; Quantum graph; Quantum graph generative adversarial network; Quantum-classical; Generative adversarial networks,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,et al.; Keysight; Microsoft; Q-CTRL; QBLOX; Quantinuum,"5th IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2024",15 September 2024 through 20 September 2024,Montreal,Conference paper,

In this paper, we use the bit-flip averaging (BFA) method to mitigate frequent readout errors in quantum generative adversarial networks (QGAN) for image generation, which simplifies the response matrix structure by averaging the qubits for each random bit-flip in advance, successfully solving problems with high cost of measurement for traditional error mitigation methods. Our experiments were simulated in Qiskit using the handwritten digit image recognition dataset under the BFA-based method, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the generated images converges to 0.04, 0.05, and 0.1 for readout error probabilities of p = 0.01, p = 0.05, and p = 0.1, respectively. Additionally, by evaluating the fidelity of the quantum states representing the images, we observe average fidelity values of 0.97, 0.96, and 0.95 for the three readout error probabilities, respectively.

At the nanoscale, the quantum interconnects become comparable in complexity with the active devices and should be treated on equal footing. In addition, they can play an active role in the switching properties. Here, we investigate the charge localization in neuromorphic bi-dimensional systems, which serve as quantum interconnects (QIs) between quantum dot registers. We define a device structure where, by manipulating the charging of a floating gate array, one defines the QI potential map, which can host a few interacting electrons. The ground state charge density may be extracted by measuring the tunneling current perpendicular to the device surface, yielding a convoluted image of the electron distribution. Using image-to-image translation methods, we achieve the mapping of the charge density from the confinement potential, as well as by deconvoluting the tunneling current map, which can be obtained by a direct measurement. Thus, we provide a proof-of-concept for a reconfigurable device, which can be used to design quantum many-electron devices. © 2024 by the authors.",10.3390/app14031111,"Faculty of Physics, University of Bucharest, Atomistilor 405, Magurele-Ilfov, 077125, Romania; Research Institute of the University of Bucharest (ICUB), 90 Panduri Street, Bucharest, 050663, Romania; Horia Hulubei National Institute for Physics and Nuclear Engineering, Reactorului 30, Magurele-Ilfov, 077125, Romania; Department of Engineering, Reykjavik University, Menntavegur 1, Reykjavik, IS-102, Iceland","Preda A.T., Faculty of Physics, University of Bucharest, Atomistilor 405, Magurele-Ilfov, 077125, Romania, Research Institute of the University of Bucharest (ICUB), 90 Panduri Street, Bucharest, 050663, Romania, Horia Hulubei National Institute for Physics and Nuclear Engineering, Reactorului 30, Magurele-Ilfov, 077125, Romania; Pantis-Simut C.-A., Faculty of Physics, University of Bucharest, Atomistilor 405, Magurele-Ilfov, 077125, Romania, Research Institute of the University of Bucharest (ICUB), 90 Panduri Street, Bucharest, 050663, Romania, Horia Hulubei National Institute for Physics and Nuclear Engineering, Reactorului 30, Magurele-Ilfov, 077125, Romania; Marciu M., Faculty of Physics, University of Bucharest, Atomistilor 405, Magurele-Ilfov, 077125, Romania; Anghel D.-V., Faculty of Physics, University of Bucharest, Atomistilor 405, Magurele-Ilfov, 077125, Romania, Horia Hulubei National Institute for Physics and Nuclear Engineering, Reactorului 30, Magurele-Ilfov, 077125, Romania; Allosh A., Faculty of Physics, University of Bucharest, Atomistilor 405, Magurele-Ilfov, 077125, Romania, Horia Hulubei National Institute for Physics and Nuclear Engineering, Reactorului 30, Magurele-Ilfov, 077125, Romania; Ion L., Faculty of Physics, University of Bucharest, Atomistilor 405, Magurele-Ilfov, 077125, Romania; Manolescu A., Department of Engineering, Reykjavik University, Menntavegur 1, Reykjavik, IS-102, Iceland; Nemnes G.A., Faculty of Physics, University of Bucharest, Atomistilor 405, Magurele-Ilfov, 077125, Romania, Research Institute of the University of Bucharest (ICUB), 90 Panduri Street, Bucharest, 050663, Romania, Horia Hulubei National Institute for Physics and Nuclear Engineering, Reactorului 30, Magurele-Ilfov, 077125, Romania",conditional generative adversarial network; neuromorphic devices; quantum computing; quantum interconnects,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,,,,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

However, while there are various implementations of quantum generative adversarial networks, the integration of quantum elements into diffusion models remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose a potential version of a quantum diffusion model that leverages the established idea of classical latent diffusion models. This involves using a traditional autoencoder to reduce images, followed by operations with variational circuits in the latent space. To effectively assess the benefits brought by quantum computing, the images generated by the quantum latent diffusion model have been compared to those generated by a classical model with a similar number of parameters, evaluated in terms of quantitative metrics. The results demonstrate an advantage in using a quantum version, as evidenced by obtaining better metrics for the images generated by the quantum version compared to those obtained by the classical version. Furthermore, quantum models continue to outperform even when considering small percentages of the dataset for training, demonstrating the quantum’s ability to extract features more effectively even in a few shot learning scenario. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",10.1007/s42484-024-00224-6,"Department of Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Rome “La Sapienza”, Via Eudossiana 18, Rome, 00184, Italy; Φ-lab, ESRIN, European Space Agency (ESA), Via Galileo Galilei, 1, Frascati, 00044, Italy","De Falco F., Department of Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Rome “La Sapienza”, Via Eudossiana 18, Rome, 00184, Italy; Ceschini A., Department of Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Rome “La Sapienza”, Via Eudossiana 18, Rome, 00184, Italy; Sebastianelli A., Φ-lab, ESRIN, European Space Agency (ESA), Via Galileo Galilei, 1, Frascati, 00044, Italy; Le Saux B., Φ-lab, ESRIN, European Space Agency (ESA), Via Galileo Galilei, 1, Frascati, 00044, Italy; Panella M., Department of Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Rome “La Sapienza”, Via Eudossiana 18, Rome, 00184, Italy",Generative adversarial network; Quantum latent diffusion; Quantum machine learning; Quantum variational circuit,Adversarial machine learning; Generative adversarial networks; Photons; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Variational techniques; Adversarial networks; Auto encoders; Diffusion model; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Quantum diffusion; Quantum latent diffusion; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum variational circuit; Quantum computers,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,,,Article,

Nevertheless, building robust quantum computers involves enormous technological challenges, and therefore many attempts are devoted to closing the gaps by developing classical simulation algorithms for problems in many body physics. Among these, the most notable are machine learning algorithms. This paper contributes to the development of these toolkits by studying the power of deep generative neural networks, including variational autoencoders and normalizing flows, to represent the distributions generated by quantum computing. The results show that these modern generative networks are only capable of partially capturing features of the quantum system including the overall distribution shapes, but missing the granularities such as local spikes and annihilations in the distributions This incomplete information reconstruction might be due to the inherent limitation of the classical algorithms when encountering the complex quantum states with the exponential growing Hilbert space. The results also show that variational autoencoders perform slightly better than normalizing flows for many cases, and the complimentary strength between the expressibility of variational autoencoders and normalizing flows is observed and worth further exploration. © 2024 IEEE.",10.1109/ICDS62089.2024.10756372,"Horace Mann School, Bronx, NY, United States","Wang E., Horace Mann School, Bronx, NY, United States",generative neural network; normalizing flows; Quantum computing; quantum distribution; variational autoencoder,Deep neural networks; Encoding (symbols); Generative adversarial networks; Hilbert spaces; Image segmentation; Network coding; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Variational techniques; Auto encoders; Generative neural network; Neural-networks; Normalizing flow; Quanta computers; Quantum Computing; Quantum distribution; Science and engineering; Technological challenges; Variational autoencoder; Quantum computers,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,et al.; IEEE; IEEE Computational Intelligence Society; IEEE Morocco Section Computational Intelligence Society Chapter; International Neural Network Society; Universite Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah de Des,"6th International Conference on Intelligent Computing in Data Sciences, ICDS 2024",23 October 2024 through 24 October 2024,"Hybrid, Marrakech",Conference paper,

This paper investigates the scalability and noise resilience of quantum generative learning applications. We consider the training performance in the presence of statistical noise due to finite-shot noise statistics and quantum noise due to decoherence to analyze the scalability of QML methods. We employ rigorous benchmarking techniques to track progress and identify challenges in scaling QML algorithms, and show how characterization of QML systems can be accelerated, simplified, and made reproducible when the QUARK framework is used.

Chatbots, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), are increasingly prevalent across industries such as customer service, healthcare, e-commerce, and education. Despite their use and increasing complexity, chatbots are prone to errors like misunderstandings, inappropriate responses, and factual inaccuracies. These issues can have an impact on user satisfaction and trust. This research provides an overview of chatbots, conducts an analysis of errors they encounter, and examines different approaches to rectifying these errors. These approaches include using data-driven feedback loops, involving humans in the learning process, and adjusting through learning methods like reinforcement learning, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and meta-learning. Through real life examples and case studies in different fields, we explore how these strategies are implemented. Looking ahead, we explore the different challenges faced by AI-powered chatbots, including ethical considerations and biases during implementation. Furthermore, we explore the transformative potential of new technological advancements, such as explainable AI models, autonomous content generation algorithms (e.g., generative adversarial networks), and quantum computing to enhance chatbot training.

To this end, several steps are necessary: The underlying problem must be encoded in a quantum circuit, a suitable device must be selected to execute it, and it must be compiled accordingly. This compilation step has a significant influence on the quality of the resulting solution. However, current state-of-The-Art compilation tools treat the quantum circuit as a sequence of instructions without considering the actual application it realizes-wasting a yet untapped potential to increase the solution quality. In this work, a different approach is explored that explicitly incorporates the application considered and aims to optimize its solution quality during compilation. Initial results show the benefits of this approach: For an industry-inspired application of a quantum generative model, the proposed approach outperformed Qiskit's most-optimized compilation scheme and led to better solution quality.

Indeed, due to the inherent randomness of quantum measurements, the natural operations in MBQC are not deterministic and unitary, but are rather augmented with probabilistic by-products. Yet, the main algorithmic use of MBQC so far has been to completely counteract this probabilistic nature in order to simulate unitary computations expressed in the circuit model. In this work, we propose designing MBQC algorithms that embrace this inherent randomness and treat the random by-products in MBQC as a resource for computation. As a natural application where randomness can be beneficial, we consider generative modeling, a task in machine learning centered around generating complex probability distributions. To address this task, we propose a variational MBQC algorithm equipped with control parameters that allow one to directly adjust the degree of randomness to be admitted in the computation. Our algebraic and numerical findings indicate that this additional randomness can lead to significant gains in expressivity and learning performance for certain generative modeling tasks, respectively. These results highlight the potential advantages in exploiting the inherent randomness of MBQC and motivate further research into MBQC-based algorithms.  © 2024 American Physical Society.",10.1103/PhysRevA.110.062616,"Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Innsbruck, Technikerstr. 21a, Innsbruck, A-6020, Austria; Dahlem Center for Complex Quantum Systems, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, 14195, Germany","Majumder A., Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Innsbruck, Technikerstr. 21a, Innsbruck, A-6020, Austria; Krumm M., Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Innsbruck, Technikerstr. 21a, Innsbruck, A-6020, Austria; Radkohl T., Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Innsbruck, Technikerstr. 21a, Innsbruck, A-6020, Austria; Fiderer L.J., Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Innsbruck, Technikerstr. 21a, Innsbruck, A-6020, Austria; Nautrup H.P., Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Innsbruck, Technikerstr. 21a, Innsbruck, A-6020, Austria; Jerbi S., Dahlem Center for Complex Quantum Systems, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, 14195, Germany; Briegel H.J., Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Innsbruck, Technikerstr. 21a, Innsbruck, A-6020, Austria",,Random processes; Variational techniques; Algorithmics; Circuit modeling; Computation algorithm; Deterministics; Generative model; Measurement-based quantum computation; Natural operation; Probabilistics; Quantum algorithms; Quantum measurement; Quantum computers,American Physical Society,,,,,Article,All Open Access; Green Open Access

These factors have made it possible to process large amounts of data in a short amount of time. By using quantum computing in conjunction with deep learning models, it has been possible to explain the characteristics of ligands and their interactions with biological targets. This contributes to the process of ligand identification and ultimately results in the optimization of drug design. This review explains the extensive use of quantum deep learning in the development of drug design from traditional to quantum-powered deep learning neural networks that cover some domains like variational quantum Eigen solver, variational quantum circuits, quantum convolutional deep neural networks, QC-based deep neural networks for QSAR, as well as quantized generative models for the discovery of small drug molecules. Quantum computing can execute incredible computational work tenfold faster than current technology, transforming drug design, development, and post-marketing surveillance. This will reduce the time and resources needed to develop a medicine.

Current methods, relying heavily on first-principles Monte Carlo simulations for event showers in calorimeters, are estimated to require millions of CPU-years annually, a demand that far exceeds current capabilities. This bottleneck presents a unique opportunity for breakthroughs in computational physics through the integration of generative AI with quantum computing technologies. We propose a quantum-assisted deep generative model. In particular, we combine a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) embedded in its latent space as a prior. The RBM in latent space provides further expressiveness compared to legacy VAE where the prior is a fixed Gaussian distribution. By crafting the RBM couplings, we leverage DWave's quantum annealer to significantly speed up the shower sampling time. By combining classical and quantum computing, this framework sets a path towards utilizing large-scale quantum simulations as priors in deep generative models and demonstrate their ability to generate high-quality synthetic data for the HLLHC experiments. © 2024 IEEE.",10.1109/QCE60285.2024.10262,"TRIUMF, Vancouver, V6T 2A3, BC, Canada; University of British Columbia, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Vancouver, V6T 1Z1, BC, Canada; University of Waterloo, Faculty of Mathematics, N2L 3G1, ON, Canada; Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Waterloo, N2L 2Y5, ON, Canada; Digital Technologies Research Centre National Research Council, Ottawa, K1A 0R6, ON, Canada; University of Virginia, Computer Science and Biocomplexity Institute, Charlottesville, 22911, VA, United States","Gonzalez S., TRIUMF, Vancouver, V6T 2A3, BC, Canada; Jia H., University of British Columbia, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Vancouver, V6T 1Z1, BC, Canada; Toledo-Marin J.Q., TRIUMF, Vancouver, V6T 2A3, BC, Canada; Hoque S., University of Waterloo, Faculty of Mathematics, N2L 3G1, ON, Canada, Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Waterloo, N2L 2Y5, ON, Canada; Abhishek A., TRIUMF, Vancouver, V6T 2A3, BC, Canada; Lu I., TRIUMF, Vancouver, V6T 2A3, BC, Canada; Sogutlu D., TRIUMF, Vancouver, V6T 2A3, BC, Canada; Anderson S., TRIUMF, Vancouver, V6T 2A3, BC, Canada; Gay C., University of British Columbia, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Vancouver, V6T 1Z1, BC, Canada; Paquet E., Digital Technologies Research Centre National Research Council, Ottawa, K1A 0R6, ON, Canada; Melko R., Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Waterloo, N2L 2Y5, ON, Canada; Fox G., University of Virginia, Computer Science and Biocomplexity Institute, Charlottesville, 22911, VA, United States; Swiatlowski M., TRIUMF, Vancouver, V6T 2A3, BC, Canada; Fedorko W., TRIUMF, Vancouver, V6T 2A3, BC, Canada",calorimeters; generative AI; high energy physics; quantum annealers; restricted Boltzmann machines,Calorimeters; Chemical relaxation; Colliding beam accelerators; Hadrons; Particle interactions; Photons; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Variational techniques; Auto encoders; Generative AI; Generative model; High-energy particles; High-energy physics; Large Hadron Collider; Large-hadron colliders; Quantum annealer; Quantum Computing; Restricted boltzmann machine; Monte Carlo methods,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,et al.; Keysight; Microsoft; Q-CTRL; QBLOX; Quantinuum,"5th IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2024",15 September 2024 through 20 September 2024,Montreal,Conference paper,

Our objective is to seamlessly integrate quantum computational elements into the conventional GAN architecture, thereby unlocking novel pathways for enhanced training processes.

Our investigation deals with theoretical considerations and evaluates the potential quantum advantages that may manifest in terms of training efficiency and generative quality. We confront the challenges inherent in the quantum-classical amalgamation, addressing issues related to quantum hardware constraints, error correction mechanisms, and scalability considerations. This research is positioned at the forefront of quantum-enhanced machine learning, presenting a critical stride towards harnessing the computational power of quantum systems to expedite the training of Generative Adversarial Networks.

However, implementing such complex tasks with LLMs poses a significant challenge, as classical computers may lack the necessary space to run or store the model parameters. In this context leveraging the principles of hybrid quantum machine learning for language models offers a promising solution to mitigate this issue by reducing storage space for model parameters. Although pure quantum language models have demonstrated success in recent past, they are constrained by limited features and availability. In this research we propose the DeepKet model an approach with a quantum embedding layer, which utilizes the Hilbert space generated by quantum entanglement to store feature vectors, leading to a significant reduction in size. The experimental analysis evaluates the performance of open-source pre-trained models like Microsoft Phi and CodeGen, specifically fine-tuned for generating Prolog code for geo-spatial data retrieval. Furthermore, it investigates the effectiveness of quantum DeepKet embedding layers by comparing them with the total parameter count of traditional models. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",10.1007/s11128-024-04559-8,"Department of AI & amp; Robotics, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Vellore Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu, Chennai, 600127, India; School of Computer Science and Engineering, Vellore Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu, Chennai, 600127, India","Ahmed R., Department of AI & amp; Robotics, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Vellore Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu, Chennai, 600127, India; Sridevi S., School of Computer Science and Engineering, Vellore Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu, Chennai, 600127, India",Generative AI; Large language model; Prolog; Quantum computing; Quantum machine learning; Transfer learning; Word2Vec,C (programming language); Embeddings; PROLOG (programming language); Quantum optics; Query languages; Structured Query Language; Transfer learning; Generative AI; Language model; Large language model; Machine-learning; Prolog; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Transfer learning; Word2vec; Quantum entanglement,Springer,,,,,Article,

Contrary to existing QGM approaches, we perform training of a DQC-based model, where data is encoded in a latent space with the proposed phase feature map of exponential capacity. This is followed by a trainable quantum circuit, forming the model. We then map the trained model to the bit basis using a fixed unitary transformation, in this case corresponding to a quantum Fourier transform circuit. It allows fast sampling from parametrized distributions using a single-shot readout. Importantly, latent space training provides models that are automatically differentiable, and we show how samples from solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) can be accessed by solving stationary and time-dependent Fokker-Planck equations with a quantum protocol. Our approach opens a route to multidimensional generative modeling with qubit registers explicitly correlated via a (fixed) entangling layer. In this case quantum computers can offer advantage as efficient samplers, which perform complex inverse transform sampling enabled by the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics. On a technical side the advances are multiple, as we introduce the phase feature map, analyze its properties, and develop frequency-taming techniques that include qubitwise training and feature map sparsification. © 2024 authors.

However, QGANs typically suffer from mode collapse during the training process of generative tasks. It would make the generator only be able to generate partially correct data approximately. To solve this problem, an unrolled QGAN model based on a hybrid quantum-classical framework is constructed. The unrolled QGAN can match the generator with a better discriminator by separately training the discriminator prior to the training on the generator. The model is applied to generate quantum and Gaussian distributions, and comparative experiments are performed between the QGAN and the proposed unrolled one. Mean value, KL divergence, and standard deviation are calculated and compared to evaluate the generative performance of the model. Numerical and experimental results show that the proposed unrolled QGAN can increase the diversity and coverage of generated data distributions, significantly enhancing the generative effect. © 2024 Astro Ltd.

In this work, we investigate the barriers to the trainability of quantum generative models posed by barren plateaus and exponential loss concentration. We explore the interplay between explicit and implicit models and losses, and show that using quantum generative models with explicit losses such as the KL divergence leads to a new flavor of barren plateaus. In contrast, the implicit Maximum Mean Discrepancy loss can be viewed as the expectation value of an observable that is either low-bodied and provably trainable, or global and untrainable depending on the choice of kernel.

There are no known peptide binders for many plastics—a gap that can be filled with de novo design. Current computational methods for peptide design exhibit limitations in sampling and scaling that could be addressed with quantum computing. Hybrid quantum-classical methods can leverage complementary strengths of near-term quantum algorithms and classical techniques for complex tasks like peptide design. This work introduces a hybrid quantum-classical generative framework for designing plastic-binding peptides combining variational quantum circuits with a variational autoencoder network. We demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness in generating peptide candidates, evaluate its efficiency for property-oriented design, and validate the candidates with molecular dynamics simulations. This quantum computing–based approach could accelerate the development of biomolecular tools for environmental and biomedical applications while advancing the study of biomolecular systems through quantum technologies.

A potential application of quantum machine learning is to harness the power of quantum computers for generating classical data, a process essential to a multitude of applications such as enriching training datasets, anomaly detection, and risk management in finance. Given the success of Generative Adversarial Networks in classical image generation, the development of its quantum versions has been actively conducted. However, existing implementations on quantum computers often face significant challenges, such as scalability and training convergence issues. To address these issues, we propose LatentQGAN, a novel quantum model that uses a hybrid quantum-classical GAN coupled with an auto-encoder. Although it was initially designed for image generation, the LatentQGAN approach holds potential for broader application across various practical data generation tasks.

Considering the scarcity of quantum resources, parallelizing the execution of multiple instances of small quantum circuits instead of allocating a single circuit would better use quantum hardware resources. However, exploiting all available qubits in QPUs could result in a noisier operating condition and disrupt or slow the learning mechanism. This paper investigates the parallelization of QML algorithms on QPU for data clustering based on trainable generative models.

First, a differentiable Hartley feature map parameterized by real-valued argument that enables quantum models suitable for solving stochastic differential equations and regression problems is designed. Unlike the naturally complex Fourier encoding, the proposed Hartley feature map circuit leads to quantum states with real-valued amplitudes, introducing an inductive bias and natural regularization. Next, a quantum Hartley transform circuit is proposed as a map between computational and Hartley basis. The developed paradigm is applied to generative modeling from solutions of stochastic differential equations, and utilize the quantum Hartley transform for fine sampling from parameterized distributions through an extended register. Finally, the capability of multivariate quantum generative modeling is demonstrated for both correlated and uncorrelated distributions.

The methodology used includes the history of concepts as laid out by Koselleck, analyzing how the concept of validity is a fundamental concept. The method used is a literature review, analyzing historical and contemporary perspectives and arguments from influential authors such as Messick and Kane. This conceptual journey leads us to recognize that validity is not a monolithic entity, but a complex fabric of multiple theoretical and practical threads, ranging from the internal logic of evaluations to the repercussions of their application in society. Furthermore, validity is recognized as a complex construct that cannot be simplified to a single aspect or characteristic of a test or evaluation, differentiating between validity and validation. The five historical periods distinguished in the literature that reflect paradigmatic changes in the understanding of validity were: gestational, crystallization, fragmentation, reunification, deconstruction, culminating with the period of diffusion. The most relevant conclusion is that validity is not static but dynamic, evolving with context and application. It also emphasizes the need for continuous validation adapted to emerging challenges, such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), with the goal of ensuring that evaluations are accurate and fair amid a growing trend on ideas of quantum computing. © 2024 by the authors.",10.51798/sijis.v5i3.792,"Universidad Autónoma de Baja California UABC, Mexico","Ruiz Mendoza K.K., Universidad Autónoma de Baja California UABC, Mexico; Pedroza Zúñiga L.H., Universidad Autónoma de Baja California UABC, Mexico; López García A.Y., Universidad Autónoma de Baja California UABC, Mexico",educational assessment; generative artificial intelligence; psychometrics; validity,,Sapienza Grupo Editorial,,,,,Article,

To overcome this bottleneck, this paper introduces quantum computing techniques, exploring for the first time the application of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGAN) to broadband channel estimation challenges. Although generative adversarial technology has been applied to channel estimation, obtaining instantaneous channel information remains a significant challenge. To address the issue of instantaneous channel estimation, this paper proposes an innovative QGAN with a dual-module design in the generator. The adversarial loss function and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function are separately applied for the parameter updates of these two modules, facilitating the learning of statistical channel information and the generation of instantaneous channel details.

The proposed study aims (a) to incorporate automated method for augmentation of the MRI images using the deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN), (b) to perform feature extraction and classification by employing the pre-Trained models such as VGG16, Xception, and InceptionV3 models, (c) to develop a hybrid model by fusing the InceptionV3 features and classification using QSVM model. A total of 60 real-Time MRIs of normal (N = 30) and PD (N = 30) patients were included in this study. To increase the dataset, the proposed study employed the DCGAN approach. Thus, the dataset for this study was increased to 1000 (normal and PD) images. Automatic feature extraction and classification were performed utilizing different pre-Trained models such as VGG16, Xception, and InceptionV3. Among the pre-Trained models InceptionV3 architecture provided high accuracy of 74% compared to other models. The proposed work developed a hybrid model by fusing InceptionV3 features and a quantum support vector machine (QSVM) for the detection of PD and healthy groups. The proposed model attained a prediction accuracy of 87.5% and high precision of 95%, respectively. Additionally, the hybrid architecture provided high recall and F1-measure of 84% and 89%, respectively. The hybrid model provided lowest false negative and false positive of 4 and 1, respectively. Therefore, the hybrid model could be an effective diagnostic tool for the automated prediction of PD.  © 2024 National Taiwan University.",10.4015/S1016237224500054,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Easwari College of Engineering, Rampuram, Tamil Nadu, Chennai, India; Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering and Technology, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Tamil Nadu, Kattankulathur, 603203, India; College of Engineering and Fine Arts, Batangas State University, Philippines","Ahalya R.K., Department of Biomedical Engineering, Easwari College of Engineering, Rampuram, Tamil Nadu, Chennai, India; Nkondo G.F., Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering and Technology, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Tamil Nadu, Kattankulathur, 603203, India; Snekhalatha U., Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering and Technology, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Tamil Nadu, Kattankulathur, 603203, India, College of Engineering and Fine Arts, Batangas State University, Philippines",Convolutional neural network; Generative adversarial networks; InceptionV3; Parkinsons disease; Quantum computing; VGG16; Xception,Automation; Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Diagnosis; Extraction; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical applications; Network architecture; Neurodegenerative diseases; Support vector machines; Automated detection; Convolutional neural network; Feature extraction and classification; Hybrid model; Inceptionv3; MRI Image; Parkinson's disease; Quantum Computing; VGG16; Xception; adult; aged; Article; artificial intelligence; convolutional neural network; feature extraction; female; human; machine learning; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson disease; prediction; support vector machine; Generative adversarial networks,World Scientific,,,,,Article,

While the susceptibility of classical neural networks to adversarial attacks is well-documented, the impact on QuNNs remains less understood. This study introduces RobQuNN, a new methodology to enhance the robustness of QuNNs against adversarial attacks, utilizing quantum circuit expressibility and entanglement capability alongside different adversarial strategies. Additionally, the study investigates the transferability of adversarial examples between classical and quantum models using RobQuNN, enhancing our understanding of cross-model vulnerabilities and pointing to new directions in quantum cybersecurity. The findings reveal that QuNNs exhibit up to 60% higher robustness compared to classical networks for the MNIST dataset, particularly at low levels of perturbation. This underscores the potential of quantum approaches in improving security defenses. In addition, RobQuNN revealed that QuNN does not exhibit enhanced resistance or susceptibility to cross-model adversarial examples regardless of the quantum circuit architecture.  © 2024 IEEE.",10.1109/ICIPCW64161.2024.10769105,"Hassan II University of Casablanca, Quantum Physics and Magnetism Team, LPMC, Faculty of Sciences Ben m'Sik, Morocco; New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD), EBrain Lab, Division of Engineering, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; NYUAD, Center for Quantum and Topological Systems (CQTS), NYUAD Research Institute, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","El Maouaki W., Hassan II University of Casablanca, Quantum Physics and Magnetism Team, LPMC, Faculty of Sciences Ben m'Sik, Morocco; Marchisio A., New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD), EBrain Lab, Division of Engineering, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, NYUAD, Center for Quantum and Topological Systems (CQTS), NYUAD Research Institute, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Said T., Hassan II University of Casablanca, Quantum Physics and Magnetism Team, LPMC, Faculty of Sciences Ben m'Sik, Morocco; Shafique M., New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD), EBrain Lab, Division of Engineering, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, NYUAD, Center for Quantum and Topological Systems (CQTS), NYUAD Research Institute, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Bennai M., Hassan II University of Casablanca, Quantum Physics and Magnetism Team, LPMC, Faculty of Sciences Ben m'Sik, Morocco",Adversarial Attacks; Adversarial Robustness; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Neural Networks; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quanvolutional Neural Networks,Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Generative adversarial networks; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Quantum entanglement; Adversarial robustness; Convolutional neural network; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quanvolutional neural network; Adversarial machine learning,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Signal Processing Society,"31st IEEE International Conference on Image Processing Challenges and Workshops, ICIPCW 2024",27 October 2024 through 30 October 2024,Abu Dhabi,Conference paper,All Open Access; Green Open Access

The complexity of combinatorial optimization rises dramatically as the dimensionality of the hyperparameter space increases, making hyperparameter selection exceptionally complex. Traditional manual trial-and-error methods are both time-consuming and expensive. To break through this bottleneck, the Ansatz structure set is proposed and the Hyperband algorithm is utilized to combine the structure set with the stacking number and algorithmic hyperparameters to propose the Hyperband-QNN model. The model can intelligently generate QNN according to the actual data features, and in practical applications in many fields such as medicine and agriculture, it performs well compared with the traditional machine learning algorithms as well as the quantum algorithms QSVM and QKNN, and when it is used to deal with the large-scale data, the efficiency advantage becomes more obvious with the increase of the number of samples.

Here we propose a quantum-enhanced deep generative algorithm based on programmable quantum circuit-induced quantum latent codes. To validate the effectiveness of the algorithm, we conduct optical ghost imaging experiments, collecting dataset under varying physical sampling rates. Leveraging a physically enhanced loss function and a pretrained neural network, the quantum algorithm exhibits superior reconstruction performance compared to conventional algorithms. We observe the learnable quantum latent space enhances the out-of-distribution generalization capability of the pretrained model. In the context of computer vision problems, numerical results indicate that quantum latent space can increase the generation diversity of the pretrained model. Furthermore, the algorithm outperforms classical counterparts, particularly in image inpainting and colorization, by a significant margin.

The hybrid GAN comprises a variational generator and a discriminator quantum neural network, which are trained using a classic computer. The generator network is realized using angle-encoding and variational quantum circuits. The discriminator network is realized using multi-stage trainable encoding quantum circuits. A modular design approach is proposed for quantum neural networks which allows control on their depth to compromise accuracy and circuit complexity. Moreover, this modular approach makes the quantum neural networks amenable to scaling up the dimension of dataset and the number of qubits. Gradients of the loss functions are derived using the same quantum circuits used for the implementation of quantum neural networks to prevent the need for extra quantum circuits or auxiliary qubits. The quantum simulations are performed using the IBM Qiskit open-source software development kit (SDK), while the training of the hybrid quantum-classical GAN is conducted using the mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization on a classic computer. The hybrid quantum-classical GAN is realized using a two-qubit system with different discriminator network structures. The best performance is achieved using a five-stage discriminator network comprising 63 quantum gates and 31 trainable parameters, with the Kullback-Leibler (KL) and Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence scores of 0.39 and 0.52, respectively, for the similarity between the real and generated data distributions. © 2013 IEEE.",10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3433383,"University College Dublin, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Dublin, D04 V1W8, Ireland; University College Dublin, Center for Quantum Engineering, Science, and Technology, Dublin, D04 V1W8, Ireland","O'Dwyer Boyle A., University College Dublin, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Dublin, D04 V1W8, Ireland; Nikandish R., University College Dublin, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Dublin, D04 V1W8, Ireland, University College Dublin, Center for Quantum Engineering, Science, and Technology, Dublin, D04 V1W8, Ireland",Generative adversarial network (GAN); hybrid quantum-classical model; noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ); quantum circuit; quantum computing; quantum machine learning; quantum neural network (QNN); variational quantum algorithm (VQA),Encoding (symbols); Generative adversarial networks; Learning systems; Neural networks; Open source software; Open systems; Quantum chemistry; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Signal encoding; Software design; Stochastic systems; Classical modeling; Generative adversarial network; Generator; Hybrid quantum-classical model; Machine-learning; Noisy intermediate-scale quantum; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum neural network; Quantum neural networks; Quantum-classical; Variational quantum algorithm; Program processors,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

One example of this is the use of quantum annealers to sample from a Boltzmann distribution to assist the computation of gradients required to train Boltzmann machines (BMs). Doing so requires the interactions and weights of a BM to be mapped onto the underlying qubit connectivity built into the quantum device hardware. This opens the possibility of formulating any graph topology as a BM, instead of the more common classical approach of restricting their connectivity; i.e., Restricted Boltz-mann Machine (RBM). This work is focused on simultaneous modifications of the connectivity and qubit mapping of general BMs, which we refer to as structure-aware minor-embedding. We show how minor-embedding can be performed taking into account the nature of the BM. We also evaluate weight 'pruning', which is motivated by the intuition that, when a QAML model is pruned, the resulting qubit chains resulting from the minor-embedding methods can provide better quality samples, at the expense of a smaller model. © 2024 IEEE.",10.1109/QCE60285.2024.00196,"University of British Columbia, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Pinilla J.P., University of British Columbia, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Wilton S.J.E., University of British Columbia, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Vancouver, BC, Canada",Boltzmann machines; Minor-embedding; Pruning; Quantum Annealing,Adversarial machine learning; Graph embeddings; Graph theory; Quantum optics; Boltzmann distribution; Boltzmann machines; Embeddings; Machine learning models; Minor-embedding; Probability: distributions; Pruning; Quantum annealing; Quantum computing devices; Structural modifications; Qubits,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,et al.; Keysight; Microsoft; Q-CTRL; QBLOX; Quantinuum,"5th IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2024",15 September 2024 through 20 September 2024,Montreal,Conference paper,

The game-theoretic framework of the algorithm is inspired by the success of classical generative adversarial networks in learning high-dimensional distributions. The quantum optimal control approach not only makes the algorithm naturally adaptable to the experimental constraints of near-term hardware, but also offers a more natural characterization of overparameterization compared to the circuit model. We numerically demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed framework to learn various highly entangled many-body quantum states, using simple two-body Hamiltonians and under experimentally relevant constraints such as low-bandwidth controls. We analyze the computational cost of implementing HQuGANs on quantum computers and show how the framework can be extended to learn quantum dynamics.

However, similarly to classical machine learning, QML is not immune to adversarial attacks. Quantum adversarial machine learning has become instrumental in highlighting the weak points of QML models when faced with adversarial crafted feature vectors. Diving deep into this domain, our exploration shines a light on the interplay between depolarization noise and adversarial robustness. While previous results enhanced robustness from adversarial threats through depolarization noise, our findings paint a different picture. Interestingly, adding depolarization noise discontinued the effect of providing further robustness for a multi-class classification scenario. Consolidating our findings, we conducted experiments with a multi-class classifier adversarially trained on gate-based quantum simulators, further elucidating this unexpected behavior. © The Author(s) 2024.",10.1007/s42484-024-00208-6,"Fraunhofer Institute for Cognitive Systems IKS, Hansastrasse 32, Munich, 80686, Germany","Winderl D., Fraunhofer Institute for Cognitive Systems IKS, Hansastrasse 32, Munich, 80686, Germany; Franco N., Fraunhofer Institute for Cognitive Systems IKS, Hansastrasse 32, Munich, 80686, Germany; Lorenz J.M., Fraunhofer Institute for Cognitive Systems IKS, Hansastrasse 32, Munich, 80686, Germany",Adversarial robustness; Quantum computing; Quantum machine learning,Contrastive Learning; Generative adversarial networks; Neural networks; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Adversarial robustness; Machine-learning; Property; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum neural networks; Traditional systems; Weak points; White box; Adversarial machine learning,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,,,Article,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

Additionally, we discuss strategies by which AI may evolve to become a more potent and generally useful tool. Within the realm of classical deep learning, it appears that transformer and attention algorithms will take their place alongside generative models to enable large-scale multidimensional analysis. Moving beyond this, recent advances in neuromorphic computing and increasing sophistication of spiking neural networks will improve computational and energy efficiency. Finally, quantum computing is making great leaps forward, with machines containing over 400 qubits already available. Quantum computers will transcend the limitations of conventional computing.

A promising countermeasure is to train the quantum classifier by adopting an attack-aware, or adversarial, loss function. This paper studies the generalization properties of quantum classifiers that are adversarially trained against bounded-norm white-box attacks. Specifically, a quantum adversary maximizes the classifier's loss by transforming an input state ρ(x) into a state τ that is ϵ-close to the original state ρ(x) in p-Schatten distance. Under suitable assumptions on the quantum embedding ρ(x), we derive novel information-theoretic upper bounds on the generalization error of adversarially trained quantum classifiers for p=1 and p=∞. The derived upper bounds consist of two terms: the first is an exponential function of the 2-Rényi mutual information between classical data and quantum embedding, while the second term scales linearly with the adversarial perturbation size ϵ. Both terms are shown to decrease as 1/√T over the training set size T. An extension is also considered in which the adversary assumed during training has different parameters p and ϵ as compared to the adversary affecting the test inputs. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments for a synthetic setting.  © 2024 IEEE.",10.1109/ISIT57864.2024.10619403,"University of Birmingham, Department of Computer Science, United Kingdom; King's College, KCLIP Lab, Centre for Intelligent Information Processing Systems (CIIPS), Department of Engineering, London, United Kingdom","Georgiou P., University of Birmingham, Department of Computer Science, United Kingdom; Jose S.T., University of Birmingham, Department of Computer Science, United Kingdom; Simeone O., King's College, KCLIP Lab, Centre for Intelligent Information Processing Systems (CIIPS), Department of Engineering, London, United Kingdom",,Embeddings; Exponential functions; Generative adversarial networks; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Classical counterpart; Embeddings; Generalisation; Generalization properties; Input state; Loss functions; Machine-learning; Quantum machines; Upper Bound; White box; Adversarial machine learning,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Information Theory Society,"2024 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, ISIT 2024",7 July 2024 through 12 July 2024,Athens,Conference paper,

Yet, its promised advantages rely on efficiently translating quantum operations into viable physical realizations. Here we use generative machine learning models, specifically denoising diffusion models (DMs), to facilitate this transformation. Leveraging text conditioning, we steer the model to produce desired quantum operations within gate-based quantum circuits. Notably, DMs allow to sidestep during training the exponential overhead inherent in the classical simulation of quantum dynamics—a consistent bottleneck in preceding machine learning techniques. We demonstrate the model’s capabilities across two tasks: entanglement generation and unitary compilation. The model excels at generating new circuits and supports typical DM extensions such as masking and editing to, for instance, align the circuit generation to the constraints of the targeted quantum device. Given their flexibility and generalization abilities, we envision DMs as pivotal in quantum circuit synthesis, both enhancing practical applications and providing insights into theoretical quantum computation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.",10.1038/s42256-024-00831-9,"Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria","Fürrutter F., Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria; Muñoz-Gil G., Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria; Briegel H.J., Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria",,Diffusion; Machine learning; Quantum efficiency; Quantum optics; Timing circuits; Circuit synthesis; Classical simulation; De-noising; Diffusion model; Exponentials; Machine learning models; Physical realization; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum operations; Quantum computers,Nature Research,,,,,Article,

Later, we address the challenges of integrating services based on quantum computing (using a quan-tum search algorithm to select the best connections) with GenAI-based topology control and management in an orchestration framework. Our work also introduces multi-solution quantum search for orchestrating services across different edge clouds, emphasizing efficiency and accuracy.

Nonetheless, akin to its classical counterpart, this emerging field is not exempt from security vulnerabilities. Quantum machine learning systems, regardless of whether they process classical or quantum inputs, are susceptible to minor perturbations that can erroneously skew classification outcomes. These minute disruptions, often imperceptible to human observation, present a significant challenge in ensuring the integrity of quantum classifiers. As the complexity of quantum classifiers increases, their vulnerability also gradually grows. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes a novel hybrid classical-quantum neural network model that enhances the model's adversarial robustness by adding a preprocessing layer for noise reduction and data reconstruction.

Generative modeling, for example, is a widely accepted natural use case for quantum computers, and yet has lacked a concrete approach for quantifying success of quantum models over classical ones. In this work, we construct a simple and unambiguous approach to probe practical quantum advantage for generative modeling by measuring the algorithm's generalization performance. Using the sample-based approach proposed here, any generative model, from state-of-the-art classical generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) to quantum models such as quantum circuit born machines, can be evaluated under the same conditions on a concrete well-defined framework. In contrast to other sample-based metrics for probing practical generalization, we leverage constrained optimization problems (e.g., cardinality-constrained problems) and use these discrete datasets to define specific metrics capable of unambiguously measuring the quality of the samples and the model's generalization capabilities for generating data beyond the training set, but still within the valid solution space. Additionally, our metrics can diagnose trainability issues such as mode collapse and overfitting, as we illustrate when comparing GANs to quantum-inspired models built out of tensor networks. Our simulation results show that our quantum-inspired models have up to a 68 times enhancement in generating unseen unique and valid samples compared to the GANs explored here, and a ratio of 61:2 for generating samples with better quality than those observed in the training set. We foresee these metrics as valuable tools for rigorously defining practical quantum advantage in the domain of generative modeling, where finding a winning model remains an ongoing challenge as new architectures are developed.  © 2024 American Physical Society.",10.1103/PhysRevApplied.21.044032,"University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 2JD, United Kingdom; Zapata Computing Canada Inc., 25 Adelaide St E, Toronto, M5C 3A1, ON, Canada","Gili K., University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 2JD, United Kingdom, Zapata Computing Canada Inc., 25 Adelaide St E, Toronto, M5C 3A1, ON, Canada; Mauri M., Zapata Computing Canada Inc., 25 Adelaide St E, Toronto, M5C 3A1, ON, Canada; Perdomo-Ortiz A., Zapata Computing Canada Inc., 25 Adelaide St E, Toronto, M5C 3A1, ON, Canada",,Concretes; Constrained optimization; Quantum computers; Computing community; Evaluation scheme; Generalisation; Generalization performance; Generative model; Quanta computers; Quantum Computing; Quantum models; Simple++; Training sets; Generative adversarial networks,American Physical Society,,,,,Article,

With rapidly growing amounts of data and the omnipresence of zero-day attacks, manual and rule-based detection techniques are no longer eligible in practice. While classical machine learning approaches to this problem exist, they frequently show unsatisfactory performance in differentiating malicious from benign anomalies. A promising approach to attain superior generalization compard to currently employed machine learning techniques is using quantum generative models. Allowing for the largest representation of data on available quantum hardware, we investigate Quantum-Annealing-based Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) for the given problem. We contribute the first fully unsupervised approach for the problem of anomaly detection using QBMs and evaluate its performance on an EDR-inspired synthetic dataset. Our results indicate that QBMs can outperform their classical analog (i.e., Restricted Boltzmann Machines) in terms of result quality and training steps in special cases. When employing Quantum Annealers from D-Wave Systems, we conclude that either more accurate classical simulators or substantially more QPU time is needed to conduct the necessary hyperparameter optimization allowing to replicate our simulation results on quantum hardware. © 2024 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.",10.5220/0012326100003636,"LMU Munich, Germany; Allianz, France","Stein J., LMU Munich, Germany; Schuman D., LMU Munich, Germany; Benkard M., LMU Munich, Germany; Holger T., LMU Munich, Germany; Sajko W., LMU Munich, Germany; Kölle M., LMU Munich, Germany; Nüßlein J., LMU Munich, Germany; Sünkel L., LMU Munich, Germany; Salomon O., Allianz, France; Linnhoff-Popien C., LMU Munich, Germany",Anomaly Detection; Quantum Annealing; Quantum Boltzmann Machine,,"Science and Technology Publications, Lda",,"16th International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence, ICAART 2024",24 February 2024 through 26 February 2024,Rome,Conference paper,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

In this study, we propose a method based on inverse quantum Fourier transform (IQFT) and develop a robust IQFT-inspired algorithm for unsupervised image segmentation. The proposed method leverages the underlying mathematical mechanism of the IQFT to cluster the input image pixels automatically and efficiently into different segments. Specifically, by considering the correlation between the within-cluster mean sum of squared error (MSSE) and the probability of quantum measurements, the proposed robust algorithm significantly improves the segmentation performance. It is an unsupervised method with characteristics similar to k-means, i.e., the proposed method does not require training. Extensive evaluation of the proposed method has been carried out, showing that it outperforms the classical k-means on the PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark by as much as 4.21%, the Flowers dataset by as much as 4.4%, and the xVIEW2 challenge dataset by as much as 11.1% in terms of Intersection-Over-Union (IoU). It is also demonstrated that the proposed method has comparable or mixed performance compared to recent more complex approaches. However, compared to approaches such as GrabCut, which require a measure of the user interaction, and deep learning-based methods, which require generative models and deep feature extraction algorithms, the proposed method does not require training or user involvement. This makes it a promising choice for applications that do not have access to data before deployment or have very limited training data.  © 2013 IEEE.",10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3429413,"Prairie View A&M University, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Prairie View, 77446, TX, United States; Prairie View A&M University, CREDIT Center, Prairie View, 77446, TX, United States","Akinola T.A., Prairie View A&M University, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Prairie View, 77446, TX, United States, Prairie View A&M University, CREDIT Center, Prairie View, 77446, TX, United States; Li X., Prairie View A&M University, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Prairie View, 77446, TX, United States, Prairie View A&M University, CREDIT Center, Prairie View, 77446, TX, United States; Wilkins R., Prairie View A&M University, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Prairie View, 77446, TX, United States; Obiomon P.H., Prairie View A&M University, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Prairie View, 77446, TX, United States, Prairie View A&M University, CREDIT Center, Prairie View, 77446, TX, United States; Qian L., Prairie View A&M University, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Prairie View, 77446, TX, United States, Prairie View A&M University, CREDIT Center, Prairie View, 77446, TX, United States",Computer vision; image segmentation; inverse quantum Fourier transform; k-means; unsupervised learning,"Computer vision; Deep learning; Fourier transforms; Image segmentation; Inverse problems; Learning algorithms; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Unsupervised learning; <italic xmlns:ali=""; Grassland; Image color analysis; Images segmentations; Inverse quantum fourier transform; Quantum Computing; Quantum fourier transforms; Robustness; Xmlns:mml=""; Xmlns:xlink=""; Xmlns:xsi=""; Clustering algorithms",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,,Article,

The Industrial Revolution 2.0 was propelled by electricity- and oil-based power in nineteenth century for mass production. The Industrial Revolution 3.0 was cultivated in the twentieth century through Electronics and Information and Communication Technologies for automatic production. The current phase of Industrial Revolution 4.0 in twenty-first century is built over the Industrial Revolution 3.0; but indeed is distinct from it due to its exponential growth, scope and impact across different sectors and industries in the Anthropocene age or era of humans. The Industrial Revolution 4.0 is led by technologies with ‘Digital Intelligence’ such as ‘Internet of things’, ‘Artificial Intelligence’, ‘Cloud Computing’, ‘Quantum Computing’, etc. Within the artificial intelligence (AI), the generative artificial intelligence (GAI) with its scale, scope, and complexity will progress toward a period that humankind has never experienced before. Parallel to the development of the digitally intelligent machines have emerged a new set of generational human rights which can also be called as ‘Digital Rights’ to safeguard our human rights in digital space.

In this work, we propose quantum IL (QIL) with a hope to utilize quantum advantage to speed up IL. Concretely, we develop two QIL algorithms: quantum behavioral cloning (Q-BC) and quantum generative adversarial IL (Q-GAIL). Q-BC is trained with a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss in an offline manner that suits extensive expert data cases, whereas Q-GAIL works in an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) scheme, which is online, on-policy, and is suitable for limited expert data cases. For both QIL algorithms, we adopt variational quantum circuits (VQCs) in place of DNNs for representing policies, which are modified with data reuploading and scaling parameters to enhance the expressivity. We first encode classical data into quantum states as inputs, then perform VQCs, and finally measure quantum outputs to obtain control signals of agents. Experiment results demonstrate that both Q-BC and Q-GAIL can achieve comparable performance compared to classical counterparts, with the potential of quantum speedup. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose the concept of QIL and conduct pilot studies, which paves the way for the quantum era.  © 2012 IEEE.",10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3275075,"The University of Sydney, School of Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering, Darlington, 2008, NSW, Australia; JD Explore Academy, Beijing, 101111, China","Cheng Z., The University of Sydney, School of Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering, Darlington, 2008, NSW, Australia; Zhang K., The University of Sydney, School of Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering, Darlington, 2008, NSW, Australia; Shen L., JD Explore Academy, Beijing, 101111, China; Tao D., The University of Sydney, School of Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering, Darlington, 2008, NSW, Australia",Behavioral cloning (BC); imitation learning (IL); inverse reinforcement learning (IRL); quantum IL (QIL); variational quantum circuits (VQCs),Behavioral research; Cloning; Decision making; Job analysis; Quantum optics; Reinforcement learning; Behavioral cloning; Behavioral science; Behavioural cloning; Imitation learning; Inverse reinforcement learning; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum imitation learning; Reinforcement learnings; Task analysis; Variational quantum circuit; article; deep neural network; human; imitation; learning; learning algorithm; pilot study; reinforcement (psychology); velocity; Deep neural networks,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,,Article,All Open Access; Green Open Access

Copula distributions are a special class of multivariate distributions that have uniform marginals and have been studied extensively to model non-trivial dependencies in high-dimensional data. In the last decade, various ways of applying machine learning techniques to model copulas have been proposed to improve the pre-existing parametric models. Recently, with the advent of uniting machine learning and quantum computing, quantum generative models have been used to generate various data objects like images, probability distributions, natural language data, etc, using hybrid models that have both classical and quantum components. In this paper, we build on the recent work on utilizing quantum circuits to generate copulas and aim to provide a near-holistic study of how different quantum generative models can be implemented and tuned to capture correlations in real-world finance data.  © 2024 IEEE.",10.1109/COMSNETS59351.2024.10427073,"Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, Ce & It Department, India; Tata Consultancy Services, Tcs Research, India","Bhatuse A., Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, Ce & It Department, India, Tata Consultancy Services, Tcs Research, India; Khandelwal A., Tata Consultancy Services, Tcs Research, India; Chandra M.G., Tata Consultancy Services, Tcs Research, India",Copula; Genetic Algorithms; multivariate distribution modeling; QCBM; QGAN; qopula circuits,Clustering algorithms; Learning systems; Machine components; Machine learning; Probability distributions; Quantum computers; Timing circuits; Climate science; Copula; Distribution models; Generative model; Multivariate distribution modeling; Multivariate distributions; QCBM; QGAN; Qopula circuit; Special class; Genetic algorithms,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"16th International Conference on COMmunication Systems and NETworkS, COMSNETS 2024",3 January 2024 through 7 January 2024,Bengaluru,Conference paper,

Diffusion Models (DMs) are an emerging framework that have recently overcome Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in creating high-quality images. Here, is proposed and discussed the quantum generalization of DMs, i.e., three Quantum-Noise-Driven Generative Diffusion Models (QNDGDMs) that could be experimentally tested on real quantum systems. The idea is to harness unique quantum features, in particular the non-trivial interplay among coherence, entanglement, and noise that the currently available noisy quantum processors do unavoidably suffer from, in order to overcome the main computational burdens of classical diffusion models during inference. Hence, the suggestion is to exploit quantum noise not as an issue to be detected and solved but instead as a beneficial key ingredient to generate complex probability distributions from which a quantum processor might sample more efficiently than a classical one. Three examples of the numerical simulations are also included for the proposed approaches. The results are expected to pave the way for new quantum-inspired or quantum-based generative diffusion algorithms addressing tasks as data generation with widespread real-world applications. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",10.1002/qute.202300401,"Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Florence, Via Sansone 1, Florence, Sesto Fiorentino, 50019, Italy; LENS - European Laboratory for Non-Linear Spectroscopy, University of Florence, Via Nello Carrara 1, Florence, Sesto Fiorentino, 50019, Italy; Istituto Nazionale di Ottica del Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR-INO), Sesto Fiorentino, I-50019, Italy","Parigi M., Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Florence, Via Sansone 1, Florence, Sesto Fiorentino, 50019, Italy; Martina S., Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Florence, Via Sansone 1, Florence, Sesto Fiorentino, 50019, Italy, LENS - European Laboratory for Non-Linear Spectroscopy, University of Florence, Via Nello Carrara 1, Florence, Sesto Fiorentino, 50019, Italy; Caruso F., Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Florence, Via Sansone 1, Florence, Sesto Fiorentino, 50019, Italy, LENS - European Laboratory for Non-Linear Spectroscopy, University of Florence, Via Nello Carrara 1, Florence, Sesto Fiorentino, 50019, Italy, Istituto Nazionale di Ottica del Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR-INO), Sesto Fiorentino, I-50019, Italy",diffusion models; generative models; quantum computing; quantum machine learning; quantum noise,Complex networks; Diffusion; Generative adversarial networks; Probability distributions; Quantum computers; Quantum noise; Quantum optics; Complex data distributions; Diffusion model; Generative model; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum processors; Unknown data distribution; Quantum entanglement,John Wiley and Sons Inc,,,,,Article,

In this article, we show how to exploit them to accelerate equilibrium Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations of computationally challenging spin-glass models at low but finite temperatures. This is achieved by training generative neural networks on data produced by a D-Wave quantum annealer, and then using them to generate smart proposals for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. In particular, we explore hybrid schemes by combining single spin-flip and neural proposals, as well as D-Wave and classical Monte Carlo training data. The hybrid algorithm outperforms the single spin-flip Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. It is competitive with parallel tempering in terms of correlation times, with the significant benefit of a much shorter equilibration time. Copyright © G. Scriva et al.

This paper delves into the vulnerabilities inherent in existing models in this quantum era and introduces a novel approach aimed at fortifying their resilience. The problem at hand pertains to the susceptibility of conventional generative AI anomaly detection systems to adversarial manipulations, raising critical concerns about their trustworthiness in critical applications. Traditional methods in this domain rely on static models that lack adaptability to defend against quantum-based adversarial attacks, rendering them inadequate for the evolving threat landscape. Our proposed solution combines quantum-resistant algorithms with advanced generative AI techniques to dynamically adapt to emerging attack strategies, resulting in demonstrably enhanced robustness against quantum-based adversarial attacks, as substantiated by our experimental findings. In conclusion, safeguarding generative AI anomaly detection systems against adversarial threats in the quantum era is paramount, and our innovative approach offers a promising avenue for bolstering the security and reliability of these systems in this challenging environment.  © 2023 IEEE.",10.1109/ICECA58529.2023.10395092,"Karunya Institute of Tech. and Sci., Dept. of CSE, Coimbatore, India; SRM Valliammai Engineering College, Dept. of Electronics and Instrumentation Engg, Kattankulathur, India; PSNA College of Engg and Tech., Dept. of IT, Dindigul, India; Sri Shakthi Institute of Engg. and Tech., Dept. of CSE, Coimbatore, India","Jenefa A., Karunya Institute of Tech. and Sci., Dept. of CSE, Coimbatore, India; Ebenezer V., Karunya Institute of Tech. and Sci., Dept. of CSE, Coimbatore, India; Isaac A.J., Karunya Institute of Tech. and Sci., Dept. of CSE, Coimbatore, India; Marshell J., SRM Valliammai Engineering College, Dept. of Electronics and Instrumentation Engg, Kattankulathur, India; Pradeepa P., PSNA College of Engg and Tech., Dept. of IT, Dindigul, India; Naveen V., Sri Shakthi Institute of Engg. and Tech., Dept. of CSE, Coimbatore, India",Adversarial Attacks; Anomaly Detection; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Quantum Computing; Quantum Era,Anomaly detection; Quantum computers; Adversarial attack; AI techniques; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection systems; Critical applications; Generative artificial intelligence; Quantum Computing; Quantum era; Security and reliabilities; Static modelling; Network security,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"7th International Conference on Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology, ICECA 2023",22 November 2023 through 24 November 2023,Coimbatore,Conference paper,

This work compares a classical conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) with a quantum circuit Born machine while addressing their strengths and limitations to generate muonic force carriers (MFCs) events. The former uses a neural network as a discriminator to train the generator, while the latter takes advantage of the stochastic nature of measurements in quantum mechanics to generate samples. We consider a muon fixed-target collision between muons produced at the high-energy collisions of the LHC and the detector material of the ForwArd Search ExpeRiment (FASER) or the ATLAS calorimeter. In the ATLAS case, independent muon measurements performed by the inner detector (ID) and muon system (MS) can help observe new force carriers coupled to muons, which are usually not detected. We numerically observed that CGANs could reproduce the complete data set and interpolate to different regimes. Moreover, we show on a simplified problem that Born machines are promising generative models for near-term quantum devices. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",10.1088/1742-6596/2438/1/012089,"Laboratory of Methods for Big Data Analysis, National Research University Higher School of Economics, Moscow, 109028, Russian Federation; Department of Computer Science, University of Geneva, Geneva, 1211, Switzerland; Openlab, CERN, Meyrin, 1217, Switzerland; Department of Physics, Technion, Haifa, 32000, Israel","Ramazyan T., Laboratory of Methods for Big Data Analysis, National Research University Higher School of Economics, Moscow, 109028, Russian Federation; Kiss O., Department of Computer Science, University of Geneva, Geneva, 1211, Switzerland, Openlab, CERN, Meyrin, 1217, Switzerland; Grossi M., Openlab, CERN, Meyrin, 1217, Switzerland; Kajomovitz E., Department of Physics, Technion, Haifa, 32000, Israel; Vallecorsa S., Openlab, CERN, Meyrin, 1217, Switzerland",,Charged particles; Generative adversarial networks; Quantum theory; Stochastic systems; Classical neural networks; Fixed targets; Generative model; High-energy collisions; Neural-networks; Probabilistics; Quanta computers; Quantum circuit; Quantum neural networks; Stochastic nature; Quantum computers,Institute of Physics,Asia Pacific Center for Theoretical Physics (APCTP); Daejeon International Marketing Enterprise (DIME); Micron; The Korean Physical Society (KPS),"20th International Workshop on Advanced Computing and Analysis Techniques in Physics Research, ACAT 2021",29 November 2021 through 3 December 2021,"Daejeon, Virtual",Conference paper,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

The social cannot be separated from the technical as intelligence may evolve into a platform-agnostic learning and problem-solving capability. A suite of concepts is introduced as quantum intelligence, relativistic intelligence, and scale-free intelligence to denote learning modes which incorporate scale-specific matter and space-time properties of quantum, classical, and relativistic domains. Modern technology has both risk and reward, and offers important theoretical and practical means of achieving socially beneficial outcomes. Theoretically, intelligence as the generic capability of agents (human or machine) to treat problems in multiple scale domains allows thinking to be reconceived as an operation of multiplicity, simultaneity, and portability, opening the scope of world to a wider sphere of concern beyond the traditional individual self and local community others. Practically, producing socially responsible AI could proceed in the phased approach of a ""Moore's Law of AI Alignment"" with short-term regulation and registries, medium-term internally learned reward functions, and long-term responsible human-AI entities. Humans are not naturally socially responsible but might be more so when operating with new levels of technological sophistication aimed at planetary-scale problems. © 2023 CEUR-WS.

Our proposal depends on collaboration between the generators and discriminator, thus, we call it quantum synergic generative learning. We present numerical evidence that the synergic approach, in some cases, compares favorably to recently proposed quantum generative adversarial learning. In addition to the results obtained with quantum simulators, we also present experimental results obtained with an actual programmable quantum computer. We investigate how a quantum computer implementing generative learning algorithm could learn the concept of a maximally-entangled state. After completing the learning process, the network is able both to recognize and to generate an entangled state.

We are implementing a molecular geometry generation process using Hybrid Quantum-Classical Graph Generative Adversarial Networks (QNetGAN), STO-nG basis set, Hartree-Fock (HF) and Post-Hartree-Fock (PHF) approximations of Schrödinger's equation for molecular energy calculations using PySCF. QNetGAN generates molecular graphs, ensuring atom connectedness, druglikeness, and Octet Rule satisfaction, at a fast runtime and great efficiency. Although a work in progress, QNetGAN has demonstrated its capabilities with an impressive training time of 10.164 minutes and 47% success rate, generating 141/300 structurally valid molecular geometries that fulfill Lipinski's Rule of Five. Meanwhile, we have developed a Python-based molecular energy and properties program with proven accuracy. By testing pre-existing organic molecules using HF (and later, PHF) and comparing our experimental results with accepted values from the CCCBDB government database, we are verifying the reliability of our program and preparing to determine the stability and feasibility of future QNetGAN-generated molecules. Currently, the QNetGAN and the HF/PHF molecular geometry and molecular energy calculations are separate; future work involves improving the accuracy of QNetGAN before integrating these components together and the current classical GAN/Density Functional Theory (DFT) systems. The ultimate goal is to increase efficiency and lower costs in R&D processes, accelerating the development of new medicines and treatments for currently incurable diseases.  © 2023 IEEE.",10.1109/QCE57702.2023.10258,"Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School, Vancouver, Canada; Archbishop Mitty High School, San Jose, United States; The Quarry Lane School, Dublin, United States; Aspiring Scholars Directed Research Program, Fremont, United States","Cui M., Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School, Vancouver, Canada; Chau A., Archbishop Mitty High School, San Jose, United States; Pan M., The Quarry Lane School, Dublin, United States; Vaiyakarnam V., The Quarry Lane School, Dublin, United States; McMahan L., Aspiring Scholars Directed Research Program, Fremont, United States",generative adversarial network; Hartree Fock; machine learning; molecular energy and properties calculations; molecular generation; quantum chemistry; quantum computing,Computation theory; Computational chemistry; Diseases; Generative adversarial networks; Geometry; Hartree approximation; Molecular structure; Molecules; Python; Software testing; Generation process; Hartree-fock; Machine-learning; Molecular energies; Molecular energy and property calculation; Molecular generation; Molecular geometries; Molecular properties; Quantum Computing; Quantum-classical; Quantum chemistry,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,et al.; Microsoft; Montreal International; Q-CTRL; QBlox; Quantum Machines (QM),"4th IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2023",17 September 2023 through 22 September 2023,Bellevue,Conference paper,

In this Letter, using a programmable silicon quantum photonic chip, we experimentally demonstrate the QGAN model in photonics for the first time to our knowledge and investigate the effects of noise and defects on its performance. Our results show that QGANs can generate high-quality quantum data with a fidelity higher than 90%, even under conditions where up to half of the generator’s phase shifters are damaged, or all of the generator and discriminator’s phase shifters are subjected to phase noise up to 0.04π.

Since the density matrix ρ, which is the fundamental description for the dynamics of such systems, is high-dimensional, customized deep generative neural networks have been instrumental in modeling ρ. However, the complex-valued nature and normalization constraints of ρ, as well as its complicated dynamics, prohibit a seamless connection between open quantum systems and the recent advances in deep generative modeling. Here we lift that limitation by utilizing a reformulation of open quantum system dynamics to a partial differential equation (PDE) for a corresponding probability distribution Q, the Husimi Q function. Thus, we model the Q function seamlessly with off-the-shelf deep generative models such as normalizing flows. Additionally, we develop novel methods for learning normalizing flow evolution governed by high-dimensional PDEs based on the Euler method and the application of the time-dependent variational principle. We name the resulting approach Q-Flow and demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of Q-Flow on open quantum system simulations, including the dissipative harmonic oscillator and the dissipative bosonic model. Q-Flow is superior to conventional PDE solvers and state-of-the-art physics-informed neural network solvers, especially in high-dimensional systems. © 2023 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

To speedup certain machine learning tasks, quantum generative adversarial networks, quantum circuit Born machine (QCBM), and quantum Boltzmann machine have been proposed. These generative models can implement some specific generative tasks but have no control over the modes of the generated data. To make the generative model more intelligent and controllable, additional conditional information (such as category labels for MNIST digits) can be added to the model to guide the generation of data. A more in-depth study was carried out based on the QCBM, and a conditional quantum circuit Born machine (CQCBM) based on a hybrid quantum–classical (HQC) framework was proposed. The conditional information was encoded by adding extra qubits to guide the model training process. Experiments were conducted on both mixed Gaussian distribution and MNIST handwritten digit dataset. Numerical and experimental results show that the proposed CQCBM is able to generate the target distribution while satisfying the conditional constraints well. Compared to other conditional quantum generative models only applied to Bars and Stripes (BAS) or Chessboard datasets, the proposed model also performed well on more difficult image-generating tasks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.physa.2023.128693,"Department of Computer Science & Technology, Nanchang University, Jiangxi, Nanchang, 330031, China; School of Software, Nanchang University, Jiangxi, Nanchang, 330047, China; Department of Electronic Information Engineering, Nanchang University, Jiangxi, Nanchang, 330031, China","Zeng Q.-W., Department of Computer Science & Technology, Nanchang University, Jiangxi, Nanchang, 330031, China, School of Software, Nanchang University, Jiangxi, Nanchang, 330047, China; Ge H.-Y., Department of Computer Science & Technology, Nanchang University, Jiangxi, Nanchang, 330031, China; Gong C., Department of Electronic Information Engineering, Nanchang University, Jiangxi, Nanchang, 330031, China; Zhou N.-R., Department of Electronic Information Engineering, Nanchang University, Jiangxi, Nanchang, 330031, China",Conditional generative model; Hybrid quantum–classical framework; Quantum circuit Born machine; Quantum computation,Generative adversarial networks; III-V semiconductors; Quantum computers; Boltzmann machines; Conditional generative model; Generative model; Hybrid quantum–classical framework; Learning tasks; Machine-learning; Quantum circuit; Quantum circuit born machine; Quantum-classical; Supervised and unsupervised learning; Timing circuits,Elsevier B.V.,,,,,Article,

The integration of quantum technology into this mix will lead to unimaginable benefits and be regarded as a giant leap forward in mankind’s ability to compute. Demonstrating the benefits of this integration now becomes essential. With the advance of quantum computing, several machine-learning techniques have been proposed that use quantum annealing. In this study, we implement a matrix factorization method using quantum annealing for image classification and compare the performance with traditional machine-learning methods. Nonnegative/binary matrix factorization (NBMF) was originally introduced as a generative model, and we propose a multiclass classification model as an application. We extract the features of handwritten digit images using NBMF and apply them to solve the classification problem. Our findings show that when the amount of data, features, and epochs is small, the accuracy of models trained by NBMF is superior to classical machine-learning methods, such as neural networks. Moreover, we found that training models using a quantum annealing solver significantly reduces computation time.

This task is underscored by the Generative Learning Trilemma, which posits that it is not possible for any image synthesis model to simultaneously excel at high-quality sampling, achieve mode convergence with diverse sample representation, and perform rapid sampling. In this paper, we explore the potential of Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) for image synthesis, leveraging the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer. We undertake a comprehensive performance assessment of QBMs in comparison to established generative models in the field: Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). Our evaluation is grounded in widely recognized scoring metrics, including the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Kernel Inception Distance (KID), and Inception Scores. The results of our study indicate that QBMs do not significantly outperform the conventional models in terms of the three evaluative criteria. Moreover, QBMs have not demonstrated the capability to overcome the challenges outlined in the Trilemma of Generative Learning. Through our investigation, we contribute to the understanding of quantum computing’s role in generative learning and identify critical areas for future research to enhance the capabilities of image synthesis models. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/technologies11060183,"Division of Engineering Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, M5S 1A1, ON, Canada; Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen’s University, Kingston, K7L 3N6, ON, Canada; Quantum Computation and Neuroscience, Arthur C.

A subclass of QML methods is quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs), which have been studied as a quantum counterpart of classical GANs widely used in image manipulation and generation tasks. The existing work on QGANs is still limited to small-scale proof-of-concept examples based on images with significant downscaling. Here, we integrate classical and quantum techniques to propose a new hybrid quantum-classical GAN framework. We demonstrate its superior learning capabilities over existing quantum techniques by generating 28 × 28 pixels grayscale images without dimensionality reduction or classical pre/postprocessing on multiple classes of the standard Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and Fashion MNIST datasets, which achieves comparable results to classical frameworks with three orders of magnitude less trainable generator parameters. To gain further insight into the working of our hybrid approach, we systematically explore the impact of its parameter space by varying the number of qubits, the size of image patches, the number of layers in the generator, the shape of the patches, and the choice of prior distribution. Our results show that increasing the quantum generator size generally improves the learning capability of the network. The developed framework provides a foundation for future design of QGANs with optimal parameter set tailored for complex image generation tasks.  © 2020 IEEE.",10.1109/TQE.2023.3319319,"The University of Melbourne, School of Computing and Information Systems Melbourne, School of Engineering, Parkville, 3010, VIC, Australia; The University of Melbourne, School of Physics, Parkville, 3010, VIC, Australia; Csiro, Data61, Clayton, 3168, VIC, Australia","Tsang S.L., The University of Melbourne, School of Computing and Information Systems Melbourne, School of Engineering, Parkville, 3010, VIC, Australia; West M.T., The University of Melbourne, School of Physics, Parkville, 3010, VIC, Australia; Erfani S.M., The University of Melbourne, School of Computing and Information Systems Melbourne, School of Engineering, Parkville, 3010, VIC, Australia; Usman M., The University of Melbourne, School of Physics, Parkville, 3010, VIC, Australia, Csiro, Data61, Clayton, 3168, VIC, Australia",Machine learning algorithms; quantum algorithm; quantum circuit; quantum computing; quantum simulation,Image resolution; Job analysis; Learning systems; Quantum computers; Generator; Image generations; Images synthesis; Learning capabilities; Machine learning methods; Quantum Computing; Quantum machines; Quantum techniques; Quantum-classical; Task analysis; Generative adversarial networks,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

We connect these physics-inspired AI algorithms by unifying them under a single mathematical framework that we call Thermodynamic AI, including: (1) Generative diffusion models, (2) Bayesian neural networks, (3) Monte Carlo sampling and (4) Simulated annealing. Such Thermodynamic AI algorithms are currently run on digital hardware, ultimately limiting their scalability and overall potential. Stochastic fluctuations naturally occur in physical thermodynamic systems, and such fluctuations can be viewed as a computational resource. Hence, we propose a novel computing device, called Thermodynamic AI hardware, that could accelerate such algorithms. We contrast Thermodynamic AI hardware with quantum computing where noise is a roadblock rather than a resource. Thermodynamic AI hardware can be viewed as a novel form of computing, since it uses a novel fundamental building block. We identify stochastic units (s-units) as the building blocks for Thermodynamic AI hardware. In addition to these s-units, Thermodynamic AI hardware employs a Maxwell's demon device that guides the system to produce non-trivial states. We provide a few simple physical architectures for building these devices.  © 2023 IEEE.",10.1109/ICRC60800.2023.10386858,"Normal Computing Corporation, New York, NY, United States","Coles P.J., Normal Computing Corporation, New York, NY, United States; Szczepanski C., Normal Computing Corporation, New York, NY, United States; Melanson D., Normal Computing Corporation, New York, NY, United States; Donatella K., Normal Computing Corporation, New York, NY, United States; Martinez A.J., Normal Computing Corporation, New York, NY, United States; Sbahi F., Normal Computing Corporation, New York, NY, United States",,Bayesian networks; Monte Carlo methods; Neural networks; Quantum computers; Simulated annealing; Stochastic systems; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Bayesian neural networks; Computational resources; Diffusion model; Digital hardware; Mathematical frameworks; Monte Carlo sampling; Stochastic fluctuation; Stochastics; Thermodynamic systems; Thermodynamics,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"8th IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing, ICRC 2023",5 December 2023 through 6 December 2023,San Diego,Conference paper,

As distributions from some classes of quantum states (circuits) are inherently hard to sample classically, QGM represents an excellent test bed for quantum supremacy experiments. Furthermore, generative tasks are increasingly relevant for industrial machine learning applications, and thus QGM is a strong candidate for demonstrating a practical quantum advantage. However, this requires that quantum circuits are trained to represent industrially relevant distributions, and the corresponding training stage has an extensive training cost for current quantum hardware in practice. In this work, we propose protocols for classical training of QGMs based on circuits of the specific type that admit an efficient gradient computation, while remaining hard to sample. In particular, we consider instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits and their extensions. Showing their classical simulability in terms of the time complexity, sparsity, and anticoncentration properties, we develop a classically tractable way of simulating their output probability distributions, allowing classical training to a target probability distribution. The corresponding quantum sampling from IQPs can be performed efficiently, unlike when using classical sampling. We numerically demonstrate the end-to-end training of IQP circuits using probability distributions for up to 30 qubits on a regular desktop computer. When applied to industrially relevant distributions this combination of classical training with quantum sampling represents an avenue for reaching advantage in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.  © 2023 American Physical Society.

Extensive-form games is a general concept of games such as Go, Shogi, and chess, which have triggered the recent AI revolution, and is the basis for many important game theoretic models in economics. Quantum transitions allow for pairwise annihilation of paths in the quantum game tree, resulting in a probability distribution that is more likely to produce a particular outcome. This is similar in principle to the mechanism of speed-up by quantum computation represented by Grover’s algorithm. A quantum extensive-form game is also a generalization of quantum learning, including Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks. As an new example of quantum extensive-form games, we propose a quantum form of the Angel problem originally proposed by Conway in 1996.

This unique feature allows exponential speed-up in solving certain problems. However, this advantage does not apply universally, and challenges arise when combining classical and quantum computing to achieve acceleration in computation speed. This paper aims to address these challenges by exploring the current state of quantum machine learning and benchmarking the performance of quantum and classical algorithms in terms of accuracy. Specifically, we conducted experiments with three datasets for binary classification, implementing Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Quantum SVM (QSVM) algorithms. Our findings suggest that the QSVM algorithm outperforms classical SVM on complex datasets, and the performance gap between quantum and classical models increases with dataset complexity, as simple models tend to overfit with complex datasets. While there is still a long way to go in terms of developing quantum hardware with sufficient resources, quantum machine learning holds great potential in areas such as unsupervised learning and generative models.

A leading method towards achieving this goal is through quantum machine learning, especially quantum generative learning. Due to the intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, it is reasonable to postulate that quantum generative learning models (QGLMs) may surpass their classical counterparts. As such, QGLMs are receiving growing attention from the quantum physics and computer science communities, where various QGLMs that can be efficiently implemented on near-term quantum machines with potential computational advantages are proposed. In this paper, we review the current progress of QGLMs from the perspective of machine learning. Particularly, we interpret these QGLMs, covering quantum circuit Born machines, quantum generative adversarial networks, quantum Boltzmann machines, and quantum variational autoencoders, as the quantum extension of classical generative learning models. In this context, we explore their intrinsic relations and their fundamental differences. We further summarize the potential applications of QGLMs in both conventional machine learning tasks and quantum physics.

The drug development process is time- and resource-consuming, and it has a low probability of success. Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning technology have reduced the time and cost of the discovery process and therefore, improved pharmaceutical research and development. In this paper, we explore the combination of two rapidly developing fields with lead candidate discovery in the drug development process. First, artificial intelligence has already been demonstrated to successfully accelerate conventional drug design approaches. Second, quantum computing has demonstrated promising potential in different applications, such as quantum chemistry, combinatorial optimizations, and machine learning. This article explores hybrid quantum-classical generative adversarial networks (GAN) for small molecule discovery. We substituted each element of GAN with a variational quantum circuit (VQC) and demonstrated the quantum advantages in the small drug discovery. Utilizing a VQC in the noise generator of a GAN to generate small molecules achieves better physicochemical properties and performance in the goal-directed benchmark than the classical counterpart. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of a VQC with only tens of learnable parameters in the generator of GAN to generate small molecules. We also demonstrate the quantum advantage of a VQC in the discriminator of GAN. In this hybrid model, the number of learnable parameters is significantly less than the classical ones, and it can still generate valid molecules.

In this work, we developed a computational framework combining generative adversarial networks (GANs), machine learning (ML) classifiers, and DFT for de novo magnetic material discovery. We used the CubicGAN generative crystal structure design model for creating new ternary cubic structures. Machine learning classifiers were developed with around 90% accuracy to screen candidate ternary magnetic materials, which were then subjected to DFT based stability validation. Our calculations discovered and confirmed that Na6TcO6, K6TcO6, and BaCuF6 are stable ferromagnetic compounds, while Rb6IrO6 is a stable antiferromagnetic material. All these materials have zero energy above hull. Moreover, Na6TcO6 and BaCuF6 are found to be half metals that are highly favorable for spintronic applications. Due to the structural differences, the A6MO6 materials have a higher thermal capacity (Cv) compared to BaCuF6. At 300 K temperature, the Cv of the A6MO6 materials is around 1100 J K−1 mol−1 and that of BaCuF6 is about 176 J K−1 mol−1.

In particular, we addressed the key questions: (1) Which skills are required to support employee creativity, how does AI interplay with human creativity, and how can AI successfully complement human creativity? And (2) What are the current knowledge gaps and directions for future research on business creativity and AI? We found that AI, on its own, can handle some of the key skills required for employee creativity, such as intelligence, learning, and the ability to handle and process large amounts of data. In addition, AI can assist employees in other key skills required for creativity, such as design thinking, problem-solving, memory, and decision-making. However, there are still some key skills required for employee creativity - such as emotional intelligence, intuition, and empathy, among others - that cannot yet be handled by AI. Nevertheless, with the emergence of advanced technologies - such as quantum computing, generative AI, and super AI - we expect AI to be able to play an increasingly key role in the future of employee and business creativity.

In recent years, many interests have been attracted to developing learning models based on tensor networks, which have the advantages of a principle understanding of the expressive power using entanglement properties, and as a bridge connecting classical computation and quantum computation. Despite the great potential, however, existing tensor network models for unsupervised machine learning only work as a proof of principle, as their performance is much worse than the standard models such as restricted Boltzmann machines and neural networks. In this Letter, we present autoregressive matrix product states (AMPS), a tensor network model combining matrix product states from quantum many-body physics and autoregressive modeling from machine learning. Our model enjoys the exact calculation of normalized probability and unbiased sampling. We demonstrate the performance of our model using two applications, generative modeling on synthetic and real-world data, and reinforcement learning in statistical physics. Using extensive numerical experiments, we show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing tensor network models and the restricted Boltzmann machines, and is competitive with state-of-the-art neural network models.  © 2023 American Physical Society.",10.1103/PhysRevE.107.L012103,"School of Systems Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China; CAS Key Laboratory for Theoretical Physics, Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China; School of Physical Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; Swarma Research, Beijing, 102308, China; School of Fundamental Physics and Mathematical Sciences, Hangzhou Institute for Advanced Study, UCAS, Hangzhou, 310024, China; International Centre for Theoretical Physics Asia-Pacific, Hangzhou, Beijing, China","Liu J., School of Systems Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China; Li S., CAS Key Laboratory for Theoretical Physics, Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China, School of Physical Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; Zhang J., School of Systems Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China, Swarma Research, Beijing, 102308, China; Zhang P., CAS Key Laboratory for Theoretical Physics, Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China, School of Fundamental Physics and Mathematical Sciences, Hangzhou Institute for Advanced Study, UCAS, Hangzhou, 310024, China, International Centre for Theoretical Physics Asia-Pacific, Hangzhou, Beijing, China",,Clustering algorithms; Learning systems; Matrix algebra; Quantum computers; Reinforcement learning; Statistical Physics; Tensors; Expressive power; High dimensional data; Joint distributions; Learning models; Matrix product state; Model-based OPC; Network models; Performance; Restricted boltzmann machine; Unsupervised machine learning; article; artificial neural network; calculation; learning; machine learning; physics; probability; reinforcement (psychology); restricted Boltzmann machine; unsupervised machine learning; Quantum entanglement,American Physical Society,,,,,Article,All Open Access; Green Open Access

Statistical inference on a Boltzmann machine can be carried out by sampling from its posterior distribution. However, sampling from such a model is not trivial due to an extremely multi-modal distribution. Quantum computers have the promise of solving some non-trivial problems in an efficient manner. We explored the application of a D-Wave quantum annealer to generate samples from a restricted Boltzmann machine. The samples are further improved by Markov chains in a hybrid quantum-classical setup. We demonstrated that quantum annealer samples can improve the performance of Gibbs sampling compared to random initialization. The hybrid setup is considerably more efficient than a pure classical sampling. We also investigated the impact of annealing parameters (temperature) to improve the quality of samples. By increasing the amount of classical processing (Gibbs updates) the benefit of quantum annealing vanishes, which may be justified by the limited performance of today’s quantum computers compared to classical. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/s42484-023-00135-y,"Center for Quantum Computer Science, Faculty of Computing, University of Latvia, Riga, Latvia; Accenture, Riga, Latvia; Accenture, London, United Kingdom","Kālis M., Center for Quantum Computer Science, Faculty of Computing, University of Latvia, Riga, Latvia; Locāns A., Center for Quantum Computer Science, Faculty of Computing, University of Latvia, Riga, Latvia; Šikovs R., Accenture, Riga, Latvia; Naseri H., Accenture, London, United Kingdom; Ambainis A., Center for Quantum Computer Science, Faculty of Computing, University of Latvia, Riga, Latvia",Generative machine learning; Quantum annealing; Quantum machine learning; Restricted Boltzmann machine,Annealing; Deep learning; Learning systems; Quantum computers; Boltzmann machines; Generative machine learning; Machine-learning; Quanta computers; Quantum annealing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum-classical; Restricted boltzmann machine; Sampling,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,,,Article,

We thus propose a correction method using learning-based error mitigation for hybrid quantum-classical machine learning, which can be used by experimenters without prior knowledge of the quantum noise channel models. A correction function using linear regression models inspired by the depolarizing noise channel is trained, and the function is to correct classical probabilities of each qubit of the quantum circuit for the quantum machine learning model. In constructing the training data for the correction function, we assume that quantum circuit simulators yield classical probabilities with the noise-free state as the ground truth. In the experiments, quantum generative models, quantum neural networks, and quantum circuit learning models were used for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method on noisy quantum devices (simulation models) and real devices. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method worked well for the error correction, and the convergence speed of training the models was improved. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s11128-023-03863-z,"Toyota Central R &D Labs., Inc., 41-1 Yokomichi, Aichi, Nagakute, 480-1192, Japan","Ohno H., Toyota Central R &D Labs., Inc., 41-1 Yokomichi, Aichi, Nagakute, 480-1192, Japan",Depolarizing noise channel; Hybrid quantum-classical machine learning; Linear regression model; Quantum error mitigation; Quantum generative model,Depolarization; Learning systems; Machine learning; Quantum noise; Regression analysis; Depolarizing noise channel; Error mitigation; Generative model; Hybrid quantum-classical machine learning; Linear regression modelling; Machine-learning; Noise channels; Quantum error; Quantum error mitigation; Quantum generative model; Quantum-classical; Error correction,Springer,,,,,Article,

Music is the art of organising sounds in space and time, and it can be modelled as a dynamic system. Hence, CA are of interest to composers working with generative music. The art of generating music with CA hinges on the design of algorithms to evolve patterns of data and methods to render those patterns into musical forms. This paper introduces methods for creating original music using partitioned quantum cellular automata (PQCA). PQCA consist of an approach to implementing CA on quantum computers. Quantum computers leverage properties of quantum mechanics to perform computations differently from classical computers, with alleged advantages. The paper begins with some explanations of background concepts, including CA, quantum computing, and PQCA. Then, it details the PQCA systems that we have been developing to generate music and discusses practical examples.

They are the CC class, where classical data are processed by classical models with the quantum computing flavor, and the CQ class, where classical data are processed by quantum-based models. More research results related to the CC and CQ classes are presented in this article.

The results propose the possibility of running the model on current real hardware, but improvements are still required in some areas. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",10.1088/1742-6596/2438/1/012062,"CERN Openlab, Geneva 23, 1211, Switzerland; Institute of Physics, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland; Cambridge Quantum, Cambridge, CB2 1NL, United Kingdom; Department of Computer Science, University of Oviedo, Asturias, Oviedo, 33003, Spain; Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 1TN, United Kingdom","Chang S.Y., CERN Openlab, Geneva 23, 1211, Switzerland, Institute of Physics, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland; Agnew E., Cambridge Quantum, Cambridge, CB2 1NL, United Kingdom; Combarro E., Department of Computer Science, University of Oviedo, Asturias, Oviedo, 33003, Spain; Grossi M., CERN Openlab, Geneva 23, 1211, Switzerland; Herbert S., Cambridge Quantum, Cambridge, CB2 1NL, United Kingdom, Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 1TN, United Kingdom; Vallecorsa S., CERN Openlab, Geneva 23, 1211, Switzerland",,High energy physics; Quantum noise; High-energy physics; On currents; On-currents; Parameterized; Performance; Problem size; Quantum circuit; Quantum device; Theoretical simulation; Generative adversarial networks,Institute of Physics,Asia Pacific Center for Theoretical Physics (APCTP); Daejeon International Marketing Enterprise (DIME); Micron; The Korean Physical Society (KPS),"20th International Workshop on Advanced Computing and Analysis Techniques in Physics Research, ACAT 2021",29 November 2021 through 3 December 2021,"Daejeon, Virtual",Conference paper,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

However, their capricious nature of security threats makes classical machine learning cyber systems vulnerable. Moreover, more samples in a big data dataset in classical machine learning approaches could produce the security defence systems weaken. It may create accurate outcomes by processing information which takes longer than expected, or observe poor accuracy because of inefficient training as well as other issues. However, quantum systems have the potential to produce atypical patterns which can not be possible to produce efficiently by classical systems, so we can postulate that quantum computers could use these advantages in that it could outperform the capabilities of classical computers on machine learning tasks.

This choice may be taken on the basis of different factors related to the state of the network and of the kind of the received musical signal. In this paper we investigate the possibility to adopt the mathematical formalism of Quantum Mechanics to describe some interaction phenomena occurring during improvised networked music performances. We propose a decision-making system, having a quantum circuit in its core, where the approximated decision by performers is modeled with state superposition and probability amplitudes used in quantum computing. The model considers the levels of signal clarity (i.e., audio quality related to packet losses), latency, and musical novelty (e.g., melodic or harmonic variation with respect to a previous musical sequence) as the factors that affect the decision of a performer to select another connected performer to follow. This model may be exploited to regulate the behaviour of an artificial intelligent agent playing the role of a virtual musician in the networked ensemble (via generative music techniques). This allows to create mixed human-artificial ensembles and even fully artificial ensembles in networked contexts. © 2023 IEEE.",10.1109/IEEECONF59510.2023.10335489,"University of Palermo, Eclt - Dsmn Ca'Foscari University of Venice, Dept. of Engineering, Venice, Italy; University of Trento, Dept. of Information Engineering and Computer Science, Trento, Italy","Mannone M., University of Palermo, Eclt - Dsmn Ca'Foscari University of Venice, Dept. of Engineering, Venice, Italy; Turchet L., University of Trento, Dept. of Information Engineering and Computer Science, Trento, Italy",artificial agents; generative music; Internet of Musical Things; networked music performances; Quantum computing,Audio acoustics; Intelligent agents; Music; Quantum computers; Artificial agents; Generative musics; Improvization; Internet of musical thing; Music performance; Musical performance; Musical signals; Networked music performance; Quantum Computing; Quantum models; Decision making,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"4th International Symposium on the Internet of Sounds, ISIoS 2023",26 October 2023 through 27 October 2023,Pisa,Conference paper,All Open Access; Green Open Access

The best choice of error correction position and the improvement of decoding efficiency are problems that need to be solved urgently. This paper proposes a Grover search algorithm that targets regulatory topological codes, which can be applied to search the most likely error positions of surface code and color code with different code distances. Compared with the previous error qubit search, the error location determination time is shortened by 40%. According to the error probability of different qubits, the top 30% of the qubits are selected for centralized error correction. We use the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in machine learning as the error correction training model. The training accuracy of the original neural network can only be improved from about 65% to about 98%. Compared with the 69% training accuracy of the minimum perfect matching (MWPM) algorithm, it has been greatly improved. At the same time, in order to speed up the efficiency of decoding and solve the problem of the correlation between surface code and color code vertices and the grid space, we chose a reinforcement learning decoder. Compared with local MWPM decoding, the error correction is only 56% , and it is difficult to achieve a large error-tolerant calculation under the threshold of about 4% , which makes the error correction success rate reach 94.5% under the GAN training model, and it is better to correct the error. It is possible that the error code can be corrected at a low threshold of about 8.4%. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s11128-022-03616-4,"School of Information and Control Engineering, Qingdao University of Technology, Qingdao, China; School of Science, Qingdao University of Technology, Qingdao, China","Wang H., School of Information and Control Engineering, Qingdao University of Technology, Qingdao, China; Song Z., School of Information and Control Engineering, Qingdao University of Technology, Qingdao, China; Wang Y., School of Science, Qingdao University of Technology, Qingdao, China; Tian Y., School of Information and Control Engineering, Qingdao University of Technology, Qingdao, China; Ma H., School of Science, Qingdao University of Technology, Qingdao, China",GAN decoder; Grover search algorithm; Quantum error correction; Reinforcement learning,Decoding; Efficiency; Generative adversarial networks; Learning algorithms; Network coding; Qubits; Reinforcement learning; Coding scheme; Error correction coding; Errors correction; Generative adversarial network decoder; Grover's search algorithm; Quanta computers; Quantum error corrections; Reinforcement learnings; Training accuracy; Training model; Error correction,Springer,,,,,Article,

In this work, we provide the first practical and experimental implementation of a quantum-classical generative algorithm capable of generating high-resolution images of handwritten digits with state-of-the-art gate-based quantum computers. In our quantum-assisted machine-learning framework, we implement a quantum-circuit-based generative model to learn and sample the prior distribution of a generative adversarial network. We introduce a multibasis technique which leverages the unique possibility of measuring quantum states in different bases, hence enhancing the expressivity of the prior distribution.

So-called Born machines are purely quantum models and promise to generate probability distributions in a quantum way, inaccessible to classical computers. This paper presents an application of Born machines to Monte Carlo simulations and extends their reach to multivariate and conditional distributions. Models are run on (noisy) simulators and IBM Quantum superconducting quantum hardware. More specifically, Born machines are used to generate muonic force carrier (MFC) events resulting from scattering processes between muons and the detector material in high-energy physics collider experiments. MFCs are bosons appearing in beyond-The-standard-model theoretical frameworks, which are candidates for dark matter. Empirical evidence suggests that Born machines can reproduce the marginal distributions and correlations of data sets from Monte Carlo simulations.  © 2022 authors.

One popular technique for this employs a family of multivariate distributions with uniform marginals called copulas. While the theory of modeling joint distributions via copulas is well understood, it gets practically challenging to accurately model real data with many variables. In this paper, we show that any copula can be naturally mapped to a multipartite maximally entangled state. Thus, the task of learning joint probability distributions becomes the task of learning maximally entangled states. We prove that a variational ansatz we christen as a ""qopula""based on this insight leads to an exponential advantage over classical methods of learning some joint distributions. As an application, we train a quantum generative adversarial network (QGAN) and a quantum circuit Born machine (QCBM) using this variational ansatz to generate samples from joint distributions of two variables in historical data from the stock market. We demonstrate our generative learning algorithms on trapped ion quantum computers from IonQ for up to eight qubits. Our experimental results show interesting findings such as the resilience against noise, outperformance against equivalent classical models and 20-1000 times less iterations required to converge as compared to equivalent classical models.  © 2022 authors.

We are interested in further advancing this field, focusing on composition. In contrast to current ‘black-box’ AI methods, we are championing an interpretable compositional outlook on generative music systems. In particular, we are importing methods from the Distributional Compositional Categorical (DisCoCat) modelling framework for Natural Language Processing (NLP), motivated by musical grammars. Quantum computing is a nascent technology, which is very likely to impact the music industry in time to come. Thus, we are championing a Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) approach to develop a new generation of intelligent musical systems. This work follows previous experimental implementations of DisCoCat linguistic models on quantum hardware. In this chapter, we present Quanthoven, the first proof-of-concept ever built, which (a) demonstrates that it is possible to program a quantum computer to learn to classify music that conveys different meanings and (b) illustrates how such a capability might be leveraged to develop a system to compose meaningful pieces of music. After a discussion about our current understanding of music as a communication medium and its relationship to natural language, the chapter focuses on the techniques developed to (a) encode musical compositions as quantum circuits, and (b) design a quantum classifier.

Such a problem can be addressed through quantum generative adversarial networks (qGANs), which are noise tolerant and agnostic with respect to data. Tuning a qGAN to balance accuracy and training time is a hard task that becomes paramount when target distributions are multivariate. Thanks to our tuning of the hyper-parameters and of the optimizer, the training of qGAN reduces, on average, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic of 43–64% with respect to the state of the art. The ability to reach optima is non-trivially affected by the starting point of the search algorithm. A gap arises between the optimal and sub-optimal training accuracy. We also point out that the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) optimizer does not achieve the same accuracy as the Adam optimizer in our conditions, thus calling for new advancements to support the scaling capability of qGANs. © 2022 by the authors.

There has been a growing interest in approaching the problem of quantum state reconstruction using generative neural network models. Here we propose the ‘attention-based quantum tomography’ (AQT), a quantum state reconstruction using an attention mechanism-based generative network that learns the mixed state density matrix of a noisy quantum state. AQT is based on the model proposed in ‘Attention is all you need’ by Vaswani et al (2017 NIPS) that is designed to learn long-range correlations in natural language sentences and thereby outperform previous natural language processing (NLP) models. We demonstrate not only that AQT outperforms earlier neural-network-based quantum state reconstruction on identical tasks but that AQT can accurately reconstruct the density matrix associated with a noisy quantum state experimentally realized in an IBMQ quantum computer. We speculate the success of the AQT stems from its ability to model quantum entanglement across the entire quantum system much as the attention model for NLP captures the correlations among words in a sentence. © 2021 The Author(s).

A musical composition can be attributed by ear a certain amount of memory. These results are associated with repetitions and similarities of the patterns in musical scores. To higher variations, a lower amount of memory is perceived. However, the musical memory of a score has never been quantitatively defined. Here we aim to give such a measure following an approach similar to that used in physics to quantify the memory (non-Markovianity) of open quantum systems. We apply this measure to some existing musical compositions, showing that the results obtained via this quantifier agree with what one expects by ear. The musical non-Markovianity quantifier can thus be used as a new tool that can aid quantitative musical analysis. It can also lead to future quantum computing controllers to manipulate structures in the framework of generative music. © 2022 by the Author(s).",10.5920/jcms.975,"Department of Engineering, University of Palermo, Italy; Dipartimento di Scienze Ambientali, Informatica e Statistica (DAIS), European Centre for Living Technology (ECLT), Ca’ Foscari University, Venice, Italy; Dipartimento di Fisica, Università di Palermo, Italy","Mannone M., Department of Engineering, University of Palermo, Italy, Dipartimento di Scienze Ambientali, Informatica e Statistica (DAIS), European Centre for Living Technology (ECLT), Ca’ Foscari University, Venice, Italy; Compagno G., Dipartimento di Fisica, Università di Palermo, Italy",computational musicology; memory; non-Markovianity; open quantum systems; pattern repetition,,University of Huddersfield Press,,,,,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

RBM training can be performed using contrastive divergence (CD) and quantum annealing (QA). QA-based RBM training is fundamentally different from CD and requires samples from a quantum computer. We present a real-world application that uses a quantum computer. Specifically, we train a RBM using QA for cybersecurity applications. The D-Wave 2000Q has been used to implement QA. RBMs are trained on the ISCX data, which is a benchmark dataset for cybersecurity. For comparison, RBMs are also trained using CD. CD is a commonly used method for RBM training. Our analysis of the ISCX data shows that the dataset is imbalanced. We present two different schemes to balance the training dataset before feeding it to a classifier. The first scheme is based on the undersampling of benign instances. The imbalanced training dataset is divided into five sub-datasets that are trained separately. A majority voting is then performed to get the result. Our results show the majority vote increases the classification accuracy up from 90.24% to 95.68%, in the case of CD. For the case of QA, the classification accuracy increases from 74.14% to 80.04%. In the second scheme, a RBM is used to generate synthetic data to balance the training dataset. We show that both QA and CD-trained RBM can be used to generate useful synthetic data. Balanced training data is used to evaluate several classifiers. Among the classifiers investigated, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Neural Network (NN) perform better than other classifiers. They both show an accuracy of 93%. Our results show a proof-of-concept that a QA-based RBM can be trained on a 64-bit binary dataset. The illustrative example suggests the possibility to migrate many practical classification problems to QA-based techniques. Further, we show that synthetic data generated from a RBM can be used to balance the original dataset.  © 2017 IEEE.",10.1109/TETCI.2021.3074916,"Purdue University, Department of Chemistry, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Purdue Quantum Science and Engineering Institute, West Lafayette, 47907, IN, United States; Temple University, Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Philadelphia, 19122, PA, United States; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, HPC2 Center for Computational Sciences, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, 39762, MS, United States; Mississippi State University, Department of Physics and Astronomy, HPC2 Center for Computational Sciences, Mississippi State, 39762, MS, United States; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Quantum Computing Institute, Oak Ridge, 37831, TN, United States; Purdue University, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, West Lafayette, 47907, IN, United States","Dixit V., Purdue University, Department of Chemistry, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Purdue Quantum Science and Engineering Institute, West Lafayette, 47907, IN, United States; Selvarajan R., Purdue University, Department of Chemistry, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Purdue Quantum Science and Engineering Institute, West Lafayette, 47907, IN, United States; Aldwairi T., Temple University, Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Philadelphia, 19122, PA, United States; Koshka Y., Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, HPC2 Center for Computational Sciences, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, 39762, MS, United States; Novotny M.A., Mississippi State University, Department of Physics and Astronomy, HPC2 Center for Computational Sciences, Mississippi State, 39762, MS, United States; Humble T.S., Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Quantum Computing Institute, Oak Ridge, 37831, TN, United States; Alam M.A., Purdue University, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, West Lafayette, 47907, IN, United States; Kais S., Purdue University, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, West Lafayette, 47907, IN, United States",Cybersecurity; D-Wave quantum computer; ISCX dataset; Machine learning; Quantum annealing; RBM training; Synthetic data,Balancing; Nearest neighbor search; Probability distributions; Quantum theory; Qubits; Security of data; Benchmark datasets; Classification accuracy; Contrastive divergence; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Neural network (nn); Proof of concept; Quantum annealing; Restricted boltzmann machine; Classification (of information),Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,,Article,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access

Approximate techniques, including Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs), were proposed in literature to reduce the depth of data loading circuits. Tuning a qGAN to balance accuracy and training time is a hard task, that becomes paramount when target distributions are multivariate. Thanks to our tuning of the hyper-parameters and of the optimizer, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic was reduced of 43 - 64% with respect to the state of the art. The ability to reach optima is non-trivially affected by the starting point of the search algorithm. It also becomes manifest, after our testing campaign, that a gap arises between the training accuracies achieved by nearly-optimal and non-optimal runs.

Though generative models implemented on quantum computers are known to be more expressive than their traditional counterparts, it has empirically been observed that these models experience a transition in the quality of their local minima. Namely, below some critical number of parameters, all local minima are far from the global minimum in function value; above this critical parameter count, all local minima are good approximators of the global minimum. Furthermore, for a certain class of quantum generative models, this transition has empirically been observed to occur at parameter counts exponentially large in the problem size, meaning practical training of these models is out of reach. Here, we give the first proof of this transition in trainability, specializing to this latter class of quantum generative models. We use techniques inspired by those used to study the loss landscapes of classical neural networks. We also verify that our analytic results hold experimentally even at modest model sizes. © 2022 ICLR 2022 - 10th International Conference on Learning Representationss.

The network is then applied to Monte Carlo-generated datasets of specific LHC scattering processes. The new quantum generator architecture leads to a generalization of the state-of-the-art implementations, achieving smaller Kullback-Leibler divergences even with shallow-depth networks. Moreover, the quantum generator successfully learns the underlying distribution functions even if trained with small training sample sets; this is particularly interesting for data augmentation applications.

Variational autoencoder is one of the computer-aided design methods which explores the chemical space based on an existing molecular dataset. Quantum machine learning has emerged as an atypical learning method that may speed up some classical learning tasks because of its strong expressive power. However, near-term quantum computers suffer from limited num-ber of qubits which hinders the representation learning in high dimensional spaces. We present a scalable quantum generative autoencoder (SQ-VAE) for simultaneously reconstructing and sampling drug molecules, and a corresponding vanilla variant (SQ-AE) for better reconstruction. The architectural strategies in hybrid quantum classical networks such as, adjustable quantum layer depth, heterogeneous learning rates, and patched quantum circuits are proposed to learn high dimensional dataset such as, ligand-targeted drugs. Extensive experimental results are reported for different dimensions including 8x8 and 32x32 after choosing suitable architectural strategies. The performance of quantum generative autoencoder is compared with the corre-sponding classical counterpart throughout all experiments. The results show that quantum computing advantages can be achieved for normalized low-dimension molecules, and that high-dimension molecules generated from quantum generative autoencoders have better drug properties within the same learning period. © 2022 EDAA.",10.23919/DATE54114.2022.9774564,"The Pennsylvania State University, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, United States","Li J., The Pennsylvania State University, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, United States; Ghosh S., The Pennsylvania State University, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, United States",Drug Discovery; Quantum Machine Learning; Variational Autoen-coder,Computer aided design; Machine learning; Quantum computers; Timing circuits; Auto encoders; De novo design; Drug discovery; Drug molecules; Machine-learning; Process approach; Quantum circuit; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Variational autoen-coder; Molecules,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Cadence; CEA; et al.; HIPEAC; IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation (CEDA); NanoElec,"2022 Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition, DATE 2022",14 March 2022 through 23 March 2022,"Virtual, Online",Conference paper,All Open Access; Green Open Access

In this paper, a novel scheme for channel modeling using quantum generative adversarial model was proposed. A quantum generative adversarial network is a generative adversarial model with a quantum circuit as the generative module and a deep neural network as the discriminant module, thereby exploiting the privilege of quantum algorithms in simulating probability distributions to stochastic channel models. Experiments were conducted on IBM QX quantum computing platform. The gradient descent of the cost function and Kullback-Leibler divergence were analyzed.

The paper presents a novel family of linear, generative representations for evolving matrices. The matrices can be general or restricted within special classes of matrices like permutation matrices, Hermitian matrices, or other groups of matrices with particular algebraic properties. These classes include unitary matrices which encode quantum programs. This representation avoids the brittleness that arises in direct representations of matrices and permits the researcher substantial control of the part of matrix space being searched. The representation is demonstrated on a relatively simple matrix problem in automatic content generation as well as Boolean map induction and automatic quantum programming. The automatic content generation problem yields interesting results; the generative matrix representation yields worse fitness but a substantially greater variety of outcomes than a direct encoding, which is acceptable when generating content. The Boolean map experiments extend and confirm results that demonstrate that the generative encoding is superior to a direct encoding for the transition matrix of a Boolean map. The quantum programming results are generally quite good, with poor performance on the simplest problems in two of the families of programming tasks studied. The viability of the new representation for evolutionary matrix induction is well supported. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s00500-022-07043-6,"Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Guelph, Guelph, N1G 2W1, ON, Canada; Facultad de Ingeniería y Ciencias, Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, Av.

QuSing extracts sequencing rules from input music and uses these rules to generate new tunes, which are sung by a vocal synthesiser. We developed a method to represent rules for musical composition as quantum circuits. We claim that such musical rules are quantum native: they are naturally encodable in the amplitudes of quantum states. To evaluate a rule to generate a subsequent event, the system builds the respective quantum circuit dynamically and measures it. After a brief discussion about the vocal synthesis methods that we have been experimenting with, the paper introduces our novel generative music method through a practical example.

Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) can efficiently address combinatorial optimization problems, implement probabilistic generative models, and carry out inference (classification and regression). This monograph provides a self-contained introduction to quantum machine learning for an audience of engineers with a background in probability and linear algebra.

In the recent ef-forts, remote sensing and airborne missions have been utilized to better understand and manage wildfires. This has resulted in an exponential increase in volume of remote sensing data, which has pushed the need for intelligent automation of data extraction for wildfire studies. Machine learning offers accu-rate automation in detecting such natural anomalies and en-able decision-makers to take actions in a timely manner. Re-cent advances in machine learning algorithms, namely prob-abilistic generative methods, allow researchers and decision-makers to step beyond detection and study 'what-if' scenar-ios for wildfire occurrences. Additionally, they offer better imitations to the stochastic behavior of nature, and wildfire events. However, optimizing the performance of these proba-bilistic generative models is a computationally expensive pro-cess, specially using digital computers. On the other hand, quantum computers have recently shown a promise to reduce computationally costly training of such models and provide performance improvements. There is a body of research in-vestigating the potential for improved machine learning meth-ods in which key operations are performed on a quantum computer. In this study, we propose a probabilistic image-to-image segmentation approach combining a very well-known segmentation method, U-NET, with a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE) to not only detect wildfires but also describe the stochasticity of the phenomenon and be capa-ble of running 'what-if' scenarios. Our proposed model is compatible with training on quantum computers, which re-sults in a quantum-assisted image-to-image segmentation approach and can be used to benchmark the potential benefit of quantum computing over the classical one. © 2022 IEEE.",10.1109/IGARSS46834.2022.9883777,"Nasa Ames Research Center, Quantum Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (QuAIL); Nasa Ames Research Center, Data Science Group (DSG); Usra Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science (RIACS)","Asanjan A.A., Nasa Ames Research Center, Data Science Group (DSG), Usra Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science (RIACS); Memarzadeh M., Nasa Ames Research Center, Data Science Group (DSG), Usra Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science (RIACS); Lott P.A., Nasa Ames Research Center, Quantum Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (QuAIL), Usra Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science (RIACS); Templin T., Nasa Ames Research Center, Data Science Group (DSG); Rieffel E., Nasa Ames Research Center, Quantum Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (QuAIL)",Image-to-Image Segmentation; Quantum Machine Learning; Remote Sensing; Wildfire Detection,Decision making; Digital computers; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Quantum computers; Remote sensing; Stochastic systems; Decision makers; Image-to-image segmentation; Images segmentations; Machine-learning; Performance; Quanta computers; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Remote-sensing; Wildfire detection; Image segmentation,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS),"2022 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, IGARSS 2022",17 July 2022 through 22 July 2022,Kuala Lumpur,Conference paper,

Due to the fundamentally probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, quantum computers naturally model and learn probability distributions, perhaps more efficiently than can be achieved classically. The quantum circuit Born machine is an example of such a model, easily implemented on near-term quantum computers. However, the Born machine was originally defined to naturally represent discrete distributions. Since probability distributions of a continuous nature are commonplace in the world, it is essential to have a model which can efficiently represent them. Some proposals have been made in the literature to supplement the discrete Born machine with extra features to more easily learn continuous distributions; however, all invariably increase the resources required. In this work, we discuss the continuous variable Born machine, built on the alternative architecture of continuous variable quantum computing, which is much more suitable for modelling such distributions in a resource-minimal way. We provide numerical results indicating the model’s ability to learn both quantum and classical continuous distributions, including in the presence of noise. © 2022, The Author(s).",10.1007/s42484-022-00063-3,"Department of Physics, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, G4 0NG, United Kingdom; School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, 10 Crichton Street, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; Laboratoire d’Informatique de Paris 6, CNRS, UPMC - Sorbonne Universités, 4 place Jussieu, Paris, 75005, France","Čepaitė I., Department of Physics, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, G4 0NG, United Kingdom; Coyle B., School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, 10 Crichton Street, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; Kashefi E., School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, 10 Crichton Street, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, Laboratoire d’Informatique de Paris 6, CNRS, UPMC - Sorbonne Universités, 4 place Jussieu, Paris, 75005, France",Born machine; Continuous probability distributions; Continuous variable; Generative modelling; Quantum information,Machine learning; Probability distributions; Qubits; Born machine; Continuous distribution; Continuous probability distribution; Continuous variables; Generative model; Learn+; Probabilistics; Probability: distributions; Quanta computers; Quantum Information; Quantum optics,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,,,Article,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

Therefore, it requires one qubit per feature or pixel, while the output resolution is adjusted by the number of shots performing the image generation. This approach allows the generation of highly precise images on recent quantum computers. In this paper, the model is optimised for a High Energy Physics (HEP) use case generating simplified one-dimensional images measured by a specific particle detector, a calorimeter. With a reasonable number of shots, the QAG model achieves an elevated level of accuracy.

However, in quantum settings, the loss landscapes of commonly used distance metrics often produce undesirable outcomes such as poor local minima and exponentially decaying gradients. To overcome these obstacles, we consider here the recently proposed quantum earth mover's (EM) or Wasserstein-1 distance as a quantum analog to the classical EM distance. We show that the quantum EM distance possesses unique properties, not found in other commonly used quantum distance metrics, that make quantum learning more stable and efficient. We propose a quantum Wasserstein generative adversarial network (qWGAN) which takes advantage of the quantum EM distance and provides an efficient means of performing learning on quantum data. We provide examples where our qWGAN is capable of learning a diverse set of quantum data with only resources polynomial in the number of qubits.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Modern radiotherapy stands to benefit from the ability to efficiently adapt plans during treatment in response to setup and geometric variations such as those caused by internal organ deformation or tumor shrinkage. A promising strategy is to develop a framework, which given an initial state defined by patient-attributes, can predict future states based on pre-learned patterns from a well-defined patient population. Approach. Here, we investigate the feasibility of predicting patient anatomical changes, defined as a joint state of volume and daily setup changes, across a fractionated treatment schedule using two approaches. The first is based on a new joint framework employing quantum mechanics in combination with deep recurrent neural networks, denoted QRNN. The second approach is developed based on a classical framework, which models patient changes as a Markov process, denoted MRNN. We evaluated the performance characteristics of these two approaches on a dataset of 125 head and neck cancer patients, which was supplemented by synthetic data generated using a generative adversarial network. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores. Main results. The MRNN framework had slightly better performance than the QRNN framework, with MRNN (QRNN) validation AUC scores of 0.742 ± 0.021 (0.675 ± 0.036), 0.709 ± 0.026 (0.656 ± 0.021), 0.724 ± 0.036 (0.652 ± 0.044), and 0.698 ± 0.016 (0.605 ± 0.035) for system state vector sizes of 4, 6, 8, and 10, respectively. Of these, only the results from the two higher order states had statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). A similar trend was also observed when the models were applied to an external testing dataset of 20 patients, yielding MRNN (QRNN) AUC scores of 0.707 (0.623), 0.687 (0.608), 0.723 (0.669), and 0.697 (0.609) for states vectors sizes of 4, 6, 8, and 10, respectively. Significance. These results suggest that both stochastic models have potential value in predicting patient changes during the course of adaptive radiotherapy. © 2021 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",10.1088/1361-6560/ac2b80,"Applied Physics Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States; Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States","Pakela J.M., Applied Physics Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States, Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States; Matuszak M.M., Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States; Ten Haken R.K., Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States; McShan D.L., Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States; El Naqa I., Applied Physics Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States, Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States",adaptive radiotherapy; deep learning; head and neck cancer; Markov process; quantum computing,"Deep Learning; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; ROC Curve; Diseases; Generative adversarial networks; Markov processes; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Radiotherapy; Recurrent neural networks; Statistical tests; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Adaptive radiotherapy; Deep learning; Geometric changes; Geometric variations; Head-and-neck cancer; Internal organs; Learning approach; Quantum Computing; State vector; Stochastics; diagnostic imaging; head and neck tumor; human; receiver operating characteristic; Forecasting",IOP Publishing Ltd,,,,,Article,All Open Access; Green Open Access

It inspires many researchers from other fields to create powerful tools for various tasks, including quantum state preparation, quantum circuit translation, and so on. It is known as classical techniques cannot efficiently simulate the quantum system, and the existing works haven't investigated the quantum version of maximum mean discrepancy as the metric in learning models and applied it to quantum data. In this paper, we propose a metric named quantum maximum mean discrepancy (qMMD), which can be used to measure the distance between quantum data in Hilbert space. Based on the qMMD, we then design a quantum generative adversarial model, named qMMD-GAN, under the hybrid quantum–classical methods. We also provide the construction of qMMD-GAN that can be easily implemented on a quantum device. We demonstrate the power of our qMMD-GAN by applying it to a crucial real-world application that is generating an unknown quantum state. Our numerical experiments show that qMMD-GAN has a competitive performance compared to existing results.

Many teachers, school administrators, and policymakers have joined the movement. A consensus has emerged over the conceptual landscape of CT. Meanwhile, machine learning (ML) has triggered some major changes in many sectors of computing. Children's lives today are full of ML-driven services - take TikTok's spot-on recommendations, social media's automatic tagging of their friends in photos, and targeted personalized advertisement, just to mention a few. Children cannot learn to think about and design ML technology from learning classical programming. ML is poised to upend the CT consensus. Look at some of the changes ML has already triggered in computing. It has enabled greatly improved speech and image recognition, powerful recommendations on streaming services, autonomous navigation of cars, super-human performance in board and computer games, and even alternative-reality ""deepfake""videos. Most advances in topics above are due to hardware evolution to non-traditional, special purpose architectures, new algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) or generative adversarial networks (GAN), and new objectives and measures of success. We will show that several key CT concepts, including debugging, problem-solving workflow, correctness, and notional machines, are insufficient for ML and need to be extended. Moreover, ML introduces new concepts including neural networks, curating and training data, and reinforcement learning that are not part of CT at all. All these changes challenge the traditional views related to teaching CT in K-12. ML is not the only emerging technology appearing in the computing landscape. Quantum computing and biological computing are not far behind. We need to start rethinking how CT must evolve to anticipate and meet these challenges.  © 2021 ACM.",10.1145/3488042.3488053,"University of Eastern Finland, Joensuu, Finland; Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA, United States","Tedre M., University of Eastern Finland, Joensuu, Finland; Denning P., Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA, United States; Toivonen T., University of Eastern Finland, Joensuu, Finland",Artificial intelligence; Computational thinking; K-12; Machine learning; School,Biology; Computer games; Computerized tomography; Deep learning; Generative adversarial networks; Image enhancement; Quantum computers; Reinforcement learning; Speech recognition; Automatic tagging; Classical programming; Computational thinkings; K-12; K-12 computing education; Learn+; Machine learning technology; Personalized advertisements; Policy makers; Social media; Image recognition,Association for Computing Machinery,,"21st Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research, Koli Calling 2021",18 November 2021 through 21 November 2021,"Virtual, Online",Conference paper,

On the contrary, generative models attempt to learn the distribution underlying a dataset, making them inherently more robust to small perturbations. We use Boltzmann machines for discrimination purposes as attack-resistant classifiers, and compare them against standard state-of-the-art adversarial defences. We find improvements ranging from 5% to 72% against attacks with Boltzmann machines on the MNIST dataset. We furthermore complement the training with quantum-enhanced sampling from the D-Wave 2000Q annealer, finding results comparable with classical techniques and with marginal improvements in some cases.

As a representative deep learning framework, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has been widely used for generating artificial images, text-to-image or image augmentation across areas of science, arts and video games. However, GANs are computationally expensive, sometimes computationally prohibitive. Furthermore, training GANs may suffer from convergence failure and modal collapse. Aiming at the acceleration of use cases for practical quantum computers, we propose QuGAN, a quantum GAN architecture that provides stable convergence, quantum-states based gradients and significantly reduced parameter sets. The QuGAN architecture runs both the discriminator and the generator purely on quantum state fidelity and utilizes the swap test on qubits to calculate the values of quantum-based loss functions. Built on quantum layers, QuGAN achieves similar performance with a 94.98% reduction on the parameter set when compared to classical GANs. With the same number of parameters, additionally, QuGAN outperforms state-of-the-art quantum based GANs in the literature providing a 48.33% improvement in system performance compared to others attaining less than 0.5% in terms of similarity between generated distributions and original data sets.

As NISQ devices are too noisy for many of the algorithms with a known quantum advantage, discovering impactful applications for near-term devices is the subject of intense research interest. We explore a quantum-assisted machine learning (QAML) workflow using NISQ devices through the perspective of tensor networks (TNs), which offer a robust platform for designing resource-efficient and expressive machine learning models to be dispatched on quantum devices. In particular, we lay out a framework for designing and optimizing TN-based QAML models using classical techniques, and then compiling these models to be run on quantum hardware, with demonstrations for generative matrix product state (MPS) models. We put forth a generalized canonical form for MPS models that aids in compilation to quantum devices, and demonstrate greedy heuristics for compiling with a given topology and gate set that outperforms known generic methods in terms of the number of entangling gates, e.g., CNOTs, in some cases by an order of magnitude. We present an exactly solvable benchmark problem for assessing the performance of MPS QAML models and also present an application for the canonical MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The impacts of hardware topology and day-to-day experimental noise fluctuations on model performance are explored by analyzing both raw experimental counts and statistical divergences of inferred distributions.

In this work, we present an algorithm for learning a latent variable generative model via generative adversarial learning where the canonical uniform noise input is replaced by samples from a graphical model. This graphical model is learned by a Boltzmann machine which learns low-dimensional feature representation of data extracted by the discriminator. A quantum processor can be used to sample from the model to train the Boltzmann machine. This novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm joins a growing family of algorithms that use a quantum processor sampling subroutine in deep learning, and provides a scalable framework to test the advantages of quantum-assisted learning. For the latent space model, fully connected, symmetric bipartite and Chimera graph topologies are compared on a reduced stochastically binarized MNIST dataset, for both classical and quantum sampling methods. The quantum-assisted associative adversarial network successfully learns a generative model of the MNIST dataset for all topologies. Evaluated using the Fréchet inception distance and inception score, the quantum and classical versions of the algorithm are found to have equivalent performance for learning an implicit generative model of the MNIST dataset.

Classical Machine Learning (ML) is taking up a significant role in particle physics to speed up detector simulations. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven to achieve a similar level of accuracy compared to Monte Carlo-based simulations while decreasing the computation time by orders of magnitude. In this research we are moving on and apply quantum computing to GAN-based detector simulations. Given the limitations of current quantum hardware in terms of number of qubits, connectivity, and noise, we perform initial tests with a simplified GAN model running on quantum simulators. The model is a classical-quantum hybrid ansatz. It consists of a quantum generator, defined as a parameterised circuit based on single and two qubit gates, combined with a classical discriminator. Our initial qGAN prototype focuses on a one-dimensional toy-distribution, representing the energy deposited in a detector by a single particle. It employs three qubits and achieves high physics accuracy thanks to hyper-parameter optimisation. Furthermore, we study the influence of real hardware noise for the qML GAN training. A second qGAN is developed to simulate 2D images with a 64-pixel resolution, representing the energy deposition patterns in the detector. Different quantum ansatzes are studied. We obtained the best results using a tree-tensor-network architecture with six qubits. Additionally, we discuss challenges and potential benefits of quantum computing as well as our plans for future developments. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

On the other hand, the combined algorithms of quantum computation and classical machine learning algorithms are proposed in various styles. Especially, there exist many relevant researches about quantum generative models, which are regarded as the branch of quantum machine learning. Quantum generative models are hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, in which parameterized quantum circuits are introduced to obtain the cost function of the task as well as its gradient, and then classical optimization algorithms are used to find the optima. Compared with its classical counterpart, quantum generative models map the data stream to high-dimensional Hilbert space with parameterized quantum circuits. In the mapping space, data features are easier to learn, which can surpass classical generative models in some tasks.

Generating solutions for a combinatorial design task often involves the application of classical computing solvers that can either map or navigate design spaces. However, it has been observed that classical computing resource power-law scales with many design space models. This observation suggests classical computing may not be capable of modelling our future design space needs. To meet future design space modelling needs, this paper examines quantum computing and the characteristics that enables its resources to scale polynomially with design space size. The paper then continues to present a combinatorial design problem that is subsequently represented, constrained and solved by quantum computing.

The model allows for easy interfacing with a classical function, such as a neural network, and is trained using an adversarial learning approach. It is shown that the quantum generator is able to learn using either a classical neural network or a variational quantum circuit as the discriminator model.

In these models, we would be looking into learning the probability distribution of the input and sampling from that to generate new data samples. Since quantum computing and algorithms are inherently random, they can facilitate a natural framework in this situation. But, getting a suitable gate circuit to achieve the requisite quantum state which by repeated preparation and measurement leads to the sought-after data samples is not trivial. In this paper, we propose a quantum circuit which has a flavor of Variational Autoencoder with the usual visible and hidden nodes for input data and latent distribution. The encoder portion comprises of a suitably chosen parameterized phase ansatz and Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform blocks. Depending on whether the measurement is carried out on the hidden nodes or not, the decoder circuit, which is just not the inverse of the encoder in our case, is configured. The Kullback-Leibler Divergence is used train the circuit towards the required input distribution.

From the optimizer perspective, the primary challenge lies in the solver’s stochastic nature, and their significant variance over the random initialization. Therefore, a robust comparison requires one to perform several training curves for each solver before one can reach conclusions about their typical performance. Since each of the training curves requires the execution of thousands of quantum circuits in the quantum computer, such a robust study remained a steep challenge for most hybrid platforms available today. Here, we leverage on Rigetti’s Quantum Cloud Services (QCS™) to overcome this implementation barrier, and we study the on-hardware performance of the data-driven quantum circuit learning (DDQCL) for three different state-of-the-art classical solvers, and on two-different circuit ansätze associated to different entangling connectivity graphs for the same task. Additionally, we assess the gains in performance from varying circuit depths. To evaluate the typical performance associated with each of these settings in this benchmark study, we use at least five independent runs of DDQCL towards the generation of quantum generative models capable of capturing the patterns of the canonical Bars and Stripes dataset. In this experimental benchmarking, the gradient-free optimization algorithms show an outstanding performance compared to the gradient-based solver. In particular, one of them had better performance when handling the unavoidable noisy objective function to be minimized under experimental conditions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/s42484-021-00040-2,"Computer Science and Engineering Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, One Bethel Valley Road, Oak Ridge, 37831, TN, United States; Rigetti Computing, 2919 Seventh Street, Berkeley, 94710-2704, CA, United States; Zapata Computing Canada Inc., 325 Front St W, Toronto, M5V 2Y1, ON, Canada; Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom; Department of Mathematics, Central Connecticut State University, New Britain, 06050, CT, United States","Leyton-Ortega V., Computer Science and Engineering Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, One Bethel Valley Road, Oak Ridge, 37831, TN, United States, Rigetti Computing, 2919 Seventh Street, Berkeley, 94710-2704, CA, United States; Perdomo-Ortiz A., Rigetti Computing, 2919 Seventh Street, Berkeley, 94710-2704, CA, United States, Zapata Computing Canada Inc., 325 Front St W, Toronto, M5V 2Y1, ON, Canada, Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom; Perdomo O., Rigetti Computing, 2919 Seventh Street, Berkeley, 94710-2704, CA, United States, Department of Mathematics, Central Connecticut State University, New Britain, 06050, CT, United States",Generative modeling; NISQ; Quantum circuit Born machine; Quantum machine learning; Unsupervised machine learning,Benchmarking; Computer hardware; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Stochastic systems; Timing circuits; Connectivity graph; Experimental conditions; Gradient-free optimizations; Hardware performance; Implementation barriers; Noisy objective function; Quantum-classical; Stochastic nature; Electric network analysis,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,,,Article,

How to efciently control or manipulate the quantum system is a fundamental and vexing problem in quantum computing. It can be described as learning or approximating a unitary operator. Since the success of the hybrid-based quantum machine learning model proposed in recent years, we investigate to apply the techniques from QML to tackle this problem. Based on the Choi- Jamiolkowski isomorphism in quantum computing, we transfer the original problem of learning a unitary operator to a min-max optimization problem which can also be viewed as a quantum generative adversarial network. Besides, we select the spectral norm between the target and generated unitary operators as the regularization termin the loss function. Inspired by the hybrid quantum-classical framework widely used in quantum machine learning, we employ the variational quantum circuit and gradient descent based optimizers to solve the min-max optimization problem. In our numerical experiments, the results imply that our proposed method can successfully approximate the desired unitary operator and dramatically reduce the number of quantum gates of the traditional approach.

In this research, we present a quantum computing framework using the circuit model, for estimating algorithmic information metrics. The canonical computation model of the Turing machine is restricted in time and space resources, to make the target metrics computable under realistic assumptions. The universal prior distribution for the automata is obtained as a quantum superposition, which is further conditioned to estimate the metrics. Specific cases are explored where the quantum implementation offers polynomial advantage, in contrast to the exhaustive enumeration needed in the corresponding classical case. The unstructured output data and the computational irreducibility of Turing machines make this algorithm impossible to approximate using heuristics. Thus, exploring the space of program-output relations is one of the most promising problems for demonstrating quantum supremacy using Grover search that cannot be dequantized. Experimental use cases for quantum acceleration are developed for self-replicating programs and algorithmic complexity of short strings. With quantum computing hardware rapidly attaining technological maturity, we discuss how this framework will have significant advantage for various genomics applications in meta-biology, phylogenetic tree analysis, protein-protein interaction mapping and synthetic biology.

Here we investigate how noise affects a quantum neural network (QNN) for state discrimination, which is applicable on near-term quantum devices as it fulfils the above criteria. We find that for the required gradient calculation on a noisy device a quantum circuit with a large number of parameters is disadvantageous. By introducing a smaller circuit ansatz we overcome this limitation, and find that the QNN performs well at noise levels of current quantum hardware. We present a model showing that the main effect of the noise is to increase the overlap between the states as circuit gates are applied, hence making discrimination more difficult. Our findings demonstrate that noisy quantum computers can be used for state discrimination and other applications, such as classifiers of the output of quantum generative adversarial networks. © 2021 authors.

Finding potential applications for it has become one of the hot topics in the quantum computing community. With the increase of digital image processing, researchers try to use quantum image processing instead of classical image processing to improve the ability of image processing. Inspired by previous studies on the adversarial quantum circuit learning, we introduce a quantum generative adversarial framework for loading and learning a quantum image. In this paper, we extend quantum generative adversarial networks to the quantum image processing field and show how to learning and loading an classical image using quantum circuits. By reducing quantum gates without gradient changes, we reduced the number of basic quantum building block from 15 to 13. Our framework effectively generates pure state subject to bit flip, bit phase flip, phase flip, and depolarizing channel noise. We numerically simulate the loading and learning of classical images on the MINST database and CIFAR-10 database. In the quantum image processing field, our framework can be used to learn a quantum image as a subroutine of other quantum circuits. Through numerical simulation, our method can still quickly converge under the influence of a variety of noises. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.",10.1142/S0217984921503607,"School of Information Science and Engineering, University of Jinan, Jinan, 250022, China; School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 610054, China; School of Mechano-Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, 710071, China; Shandong College of Electronic Technology, Jinan, 250022, China","Ren W., School of Information Science and Engineering, University of Jinan, Jinan, 250022, China; Li Z., School of Information Science and Engineering, University of Jinan, Jinan, 250022, China; Huang Y., School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 610054, China; Guo R., School of Mechano-Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, 710071, China; Feng L., School of Mechano-Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, 710071, China; Li H., Shandong College of Electronic Technology, Jinan, 250022, China; Li Y., School of Information Science and Engineering, University of Jinan, Jinan, 250022, China; Li X., School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 610054, China",Quantum generative adversarial framework; quantum image processing; quantum noise,,World Scientific,,,,,Article,

Recent breakthroughs in the field of digital twins and Edge-based AI already enable digital optimization of individual process steps. However, high-value goods typically include multiple step process chains including a broad range from generative and additive processes over several steps of material removal up to assembly. Therefore, a digital twin over the holistic process chain is necessary. While even the set-up of representative twins for a single step is already challenging, a concept for monitoring of the interaction and overall quality control of holistic process chains does not exist yet. The paper introduces a machine-learning method based on probabilistic Bayesian networks to monitor the »digital twin quality« of coupled digital twins which includes several sub-instances of digital twins. The approach identifies the contribution of each instance to the overall prediction quality. Furthermore, it is possible to give a range-estimation for the prediction accuracy of the individual sub-instances. It is therefore possible to identify the most influential sub-instances of digital twins as well as their individual prediction quality. With the help of this information, the quality of the digital twin can be improved by considering individual sub-instances in a targeted manner. Finally, a preview emphasises the potential benefits of the quantum computing technology when dealing with parallel computation of large-scale inference models. © Institute for Production and Logistics Research GbR Herberger & Hübner.",10.15488/11266,"Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU, Dresden, Germany; Technische Universität Dresden, Institute for Machine Tools and Control Engineering, Dresden, Germany","Selch M., Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU, Dresden, Germany; Hänel A., Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU, Dresden, Germany; Frieß U., Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU, Dresden, Germany; Ihlenfeldt S., Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU, Dresden, Germany, Technische Universität Dresden, Institute for Machine Tools and Control Engineering, Dresden, Germany",Bayesian Networks; Digital twin; Digitalisation; Machine Learning; Process chain model; Quantum Computing,,Publish-Ing in cooperation with TIB - Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology University Library,,"2nd Conference on Production Systems and Logistics, CPSL 2021",10 August 2021 through 11 August 2021,"Virtual, Online",Conference paper,

Such hybrid systems have already shown the potential to tackle real-world tasks in supervised and generative learning, and recent works have established their provable advantages in special artificial tasks. Yet, in the case of reinforcement learning, which is arguably most challenging and where learning boosts would be extremely valuable, no proposal has been successful in solving even standard benchmarking tasks, nor in showing a theoretical learning advantage over classical algorithms. In this work, we achieve both. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning model using very few qubits, which we show can be effectively trained to solve several standard benchmarking environments. Moreover, we demonstrate, and formally prove, the ability of parametrized quantum circuits to solve certain learning tasks that are intractable to classical models, including current state-of-art deep neural networks, under the widely-believed classical hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. © 2021 Neural information processing systems foundation.

In this work, we investigate and compare the capabilities of quantum versus classical models for the task of generative modelling in machine learning. We use a real world financial dataset consisting of correlated currency pairs and compare two models in their ability to learn the resulting distribution - a restricted Boltzmann machine, and a quantum circuit Born machine. We provide extensive numerical results indicating that the simulated Born machine always at least matches the performance of the Boltzmann machine in this task, and demonstrates superior performance as the model scales. We perform experiments on both simulated and physical quantum chips using the Rigetti QCSTM platform, and also are able to partially train the largest instance to date of a quantum circuit Born machine on quantum hardware.

In contrast to existing methods, this implementation facilitates near-term compatible QBM training with gradients of the actual loss function for arbitrary parameterized Hamiltonians which do not necessarily have to be fully visible but may also include hidden units.

Theoretical, numerical, and experimental explorations will most likely be required to understand its power. There have been different algorithms proposed to exploit the probabilistic nature of variational quantum circuits for generative modeling. In this paper, a hybrid architecture for quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) is employed and their robustness in the presence of noise is studied. A simple way of adding different types of noise to the quantum generator circuit is devised, and the noisy hybrid QGANs (HQGANs) are simulated numerically to learn continuous probability distributions, and to show that the performance of HQGANs remains unaffected. The effect of different parameters on the training time is also investigated to reduce the computational scaling of the algorithm and simplify its deployment on a quantum computer. The training on Rigetti's Aspen-4-2Q-A quantum processing unit is then performed, and the results from the training are presented.

Proposed recently, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is considered as one of the leading candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the near term. QAOA is a variational hybrid quantumclassical algorithm for approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems. The quality of the solution obtained by QAOA for a given problem instance depends on the performance of the classical optimizer used to optimize the variational parameters. In this paper, we formulate the problem of finding optimal QAOA parameters as a learning task in which the knowledge gained from solving training instances can be leveraged to find high-quality solutions for unseen test instances. To this end, we develop two machine-learning-based approaches. Our first approach adopts a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to learn a policy network to optimize QAOA circuits. Our second approach adopts a kernel density estimation (KDE) technique to learn a generative model of optimal QAOA parameters. In both approaches, the training procedure is performed on small-sized problem instances that can be simulated on a classical computer; yet the learned RL policy and the generative model can be used to efficiently solve larger problems. Extensive simulations using the IBM Qiskit Aer quantum circuit simulator demonstrate that our proposed RL- and KDE-based approaches reduce the optimality gap by factors up to 30.15 when compared with other commonly used off-the-shelf optimizers.

In cancer research, variations of molecular docking have been employed for mapping protein-phytochemical interactions, seeking alternative approaches to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. In neurodegenerative pathologies, progressing research on phytotherapies may lead to effective substitutes for palliative treatments. In Parkinson’s disease, for instance, temporary relief results from usage of dopamine agonists, mimicking wild-field dopamine action, in the brain, and stimulating dopamine receptors. On the contrary, plant secondary metabolites are promising, offering long-term modulation of biomarkers for neuro-dysfunction. For nearly a decade, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been reporting on critical trends in cancer, cardiovascular and neurological disorders. According to WHO, in 2005, neuropathologies resulted in 92 million DALYs (disability-adjusted life years), a measure of disease burden, in terms of reducing life expectancy. The figures are projected to peak at 103 million in 2030, representing 12% increase. The predictions for Alzheimer and other dementias indicate 66% increase, between 2005 and 2030. Therefore, it urges finding effective measures to mitigate these trends. In 2017, regenerative medicine saw 5H-purin-6-amine from Sedum sarmentosum extracts, modulating signalling pathways, contributing to increase of spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) activity. This is key in fertility studies, because 5H-purin-6-amine seems to induce SSC concentration within germ cells. However, the benefits of increasing phytochemical extracts-driven stem cell activity go beyond that, with the highmobility group box 1 (HMGB1) acting as a key upstream mediator in tissue regeneration. Computing is fast becoming a key instrument in drug discovery. Big data analytics and process automation are the domain knowledge revolutionising the field. On one hand, governing large volumes of heterogeneous information challenges drug development. On the other, it brings about rich sources of insights employed in unveiling new medicinal phenotypes and repurposing existing ones. One singular example derives from ontologies used to characterise molecular compounds, forming the basis of large annotated standardised information systems where medicinal compounds are assembled, in dictionaries (e.g. SNOMED) and semantic networks (e.g. Unified Medical Language System). Undoubtedly, the ability to correlate this data is fundamental, endowing conventional systems with cognitive power (e.g. biotechnology empowered by cognitive analytics), to analyse genotype-phenotype pairs, target compounds’ interactions, and track diseases’ biomarkers, to both elucidate and designate potential ligand-receptor binding prone to modulate dysfunction in diseases’ signalling cascades. Within this ambit, this chapter discusses how technology has revolutionised pharmacology.

In this paper, we explore the ability of generative adversarial networks (GANs) based on quantum computing. More specifically, we propose a quantum GAN for generating classical discrete distribution, which has a classical-quantum hybrid architecture and is composed of a parameterized quantum circuit as the generator and a classical neural network as the discriminator. The parameterized quantum circuit only consists of simple one-qubit rotation gates and two-qubit controlled-phase gates that are available in current quantum devices. Our scheme has the following characteristics and potential advantages: (i) It is intrinsically capable of generating discrete data (e.g., text data), while classical GANs are clumsy for this task due to the vanishing gradient problem. (ii) Our scheme avoids the input/output bottlenecks embarrassing most of the existing quantum learning algorithms that either require to encode the classical input data into quantum states, or output a quantum state corresponding to the solution instead of giving the solution itself, which inevitably compromises the speedup of the quantum algorithm. (iii) The probability distribution implicitly given by data samples can be loaded into a quantum state, which may be useful for some further applications. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.ins.2020.05.127,"College of Mathematics and Informatics, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China; School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Foshan University, Foshan, 528000, China; School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510006, China; Center for Quantum Computing, Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, 518055, China; Institute for Quantum Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, 518055, China","Situ H., College of Mathematics and Informatics, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China; He Z., School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Foshan University, Foshan, 528000, China; Wang Y., School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510006, China; Li L., School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510006, China; Zheng S., Center for Quantum Computing, Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, 518055, China, Institute for Quantum Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, 518055, China",Quantum algorithm; Quantum computing; Quantum machine learning,Learning algorithms; Probability distributions; Qubits; Adversarial networks; Classical neural networks; Classical-quantum; Controlled phase gate; Discrete distribution; Hybrid architectures; Quantum algorithms; Vanishing gradient; Quantum optics,Elsevier Inc.,,,,,Article,All Open Access; Green Open Access

Our work explores the feasibility of using the D-Wave as a sampler for a machine learning task. We describe a hybrid method that combines a classical deep neural network autoencoder with a quantum annealing Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) using the D-Wave for image generation. Our method overcomes two key limitations in the 2000-qubit D-Wave processor, namely the limited number of qubits available to accommodate typical problem sizes for fully connected quantum objective functions, and samples that are binary pixel representations. As a consequence of these limitations we are able to show how we achieved nearly a 22-fold compression factor of grayscale 28 x 28 sized images to binary 6 x 6 sized images with a lossy recovery of the original 28 x 28 grayscale images. We further show how generating samples from the D-Wave after training the RBM, resulted in 28 x 28 images that were variations of the original input data distribution, as opposed to recreating the training samples. We evaluated the quality of this method by using a downstream classification method. We formulated a MNIST classification problem using a deep convolutional neural network that used samples from the quantum RBM to train the MNIST classifier and compared the results with a MNIST classifier trained with the original MNIST training data set, as well as a MNIST classifier trained using classical RBM samples. We also explored using a secondary dataset, the MNIST Fashion dataset and demonstrate the first quantum-generated fashion. Our hybrid autoencoder approach indicates advantage for RBM results relative to the use of a current RBM classical computer implementation for image-based machine learning and even more promising results for the next generation D-Wave quantum system. Our method for compression and image mappings is not constrained to RBMs, the autoencoder part of this method could be coupled with other quantum-based algorithms. © 2020 SPIE.",10.1117/12.2558832,"Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, United States","Sleeman J., Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, United States; Dorband J., Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, United States; Halem M., Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, United States",Autoencoder; D-Wave; Data Compression; Deep Learning; Quantum Annealing; Quantum Computing; Restricted Boltzmann Machine,Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Quantum communication; Quantum optics; Qubits; Classification methods; Compression factor; Computer implementations; Generating samples; Machine learning problem; Objective functions; Restricted boltzmann machine; Training data sets; Image compression,SPIE,The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE),"Quantum Information Science, Sensing, and Computation XII 2020",27 April 2020 through 8 May 2020,None,Conference paper,All Open Access; Green Open Access

This paper proposes QC-based deep learning methods for fault diagnosis that exploit their unique capabilities to overcome the computational challenges faced by conventional data-driven approaches performed on classical computers. Deep belief networks are integrated into the proposed fault diagnosis model and are used to extract features at different levels for normal and faulty process operations. The QC-based fault diagnosis model uses a quantum computing assisted generative training process followed by discriminative training to address the shortcomings of classical algorithms. To demonstrate its applicability and efficiency, the proposed fault diagnosis method is applied to process monitoring of continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and Tennessee Eastman (TE) process. The proposed QC-based deep learning approach enjoys superior fault detection and diagnosis performance with obtained average fault detection rates of 79.2% and 99.39% for CSTR and TE process, respectively. © 2020",10.1016/j.compchemeng.2020.107119,"Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14853, NY, United States","Ajagekar A., Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14853, NY, United States; You F., Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14853, NY, United States",Deep learning; Fault detection; Process monitoring; Quantum computing,Failure analysis; Fault detection; Learning systems; Process monitoring; Quantum computers; Computational challenges; Continuous stirred tank reactor; Data-driven approach; Discriminative training; Fault detection and diagnosis; Fault detection rate; Fault diagnosis method; Fault diagnosis model; Deep learning,Elsevier Ltd,,,,,Article,All Open Access; Green Open Access

Here, we take a first step towards addressing this challenge by performing a comparison of the widely used classical ML models known as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), against a recently proposed quantum model, now known as quantum circuit Born machines (QCBMs). Both models address the same hard tasks in unsupervised generative modeling, with QCBMs exploiting the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and a candidate for near-term quantum computers, as experimentally demonstrated in three different quantum hardware architectures to date. To address the question of the performance of the quantum model on real-world classical data sets, we construct scenarios from a probabilistic version out of the well-known portfolio optimization problem in finance, by using time-series pricing data from asset subsets of the S&P500 stock market index. It is remarkable to find that, under the same number of resources in terms of parameters for both classical and quantum models, the quantum models seem to have superior performance on typical instances when compared with the canonical training of the RBMs. Our simulations are grounded on a hardware efficient realization of the QCBMs on ion-trap quantum computers, by using their native gate sets, and therefore readily implementable in near-term quantum devices. © 2020 The Author(s).

Here, we propose a generative TN classification (GTNC) model for supervised machine learning. The strategy is first to map the classical data onto the states in a many-body Hilbert space and then to capture these states with tensor network schemes. We adopt the TN in the form of matrix product states as an example to implement GTNC where the testing images are classified by comparing the fidelities between different states. Our results show that GTNC has a very impressive performance on benchmark datasets in comparison to several well-known machine learning models. The advantage of GTNC is reflected from the facts that the samples are naturally clustering in the many-body Hilbert space, and it relies much less on hyperparameters. These characters make GTNC an adaptive and universal quantum-inspired method, which would have important applications in quantum computation and quantum information. © 2020 American Physical Society.",10.1103/PhysRevB.101.075135,"School of Physical Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, P.O.

In digital quantum computing, it has been shown that random parametrized quantum circuits are able to express complex distributions intractable by a classical computer, leading to the demonstration of quantum supremacy. However, their chaotic nature makes parameter optimization challenging in variational approaches. Evidence of similar classically intractable expressibility has been recently demonstrated in analog quantum computing with driven many-body systems. A thorough investigation of trainability of such analog systems is yet to be performed. In this work we investigate how the interplay between external driving and disorder in the system dictates the trainability and expressibility of interacting quantum systems. We show that if the system thermalizes, the training fails at the expense of the large expressibility, while the opposite happens when the system enters the many-body localized (MBL) phase. From this observation we devise a protocol using quenched MBL dynamics which allows accurate trainability while keeping the overall dynamics in the quantum supremacy regime. Our work shows the fundamental connection between quantum many-body physics and its application in machine learning. We conclude our work with an example application in generative modeling employing a well studied analog many-body model of a driven Ising spin chain. Our approach can be implemented with a variety of available quantum platforms including cold ions, atoms, and superconducting circuits. © 2020 authors.

PQC's have been also considered to realize high fidelity quantum gates with the available imperfect native gates of a target quantum hardware. Parameters of a P QC are determined through an iterative training process for a target noisy quantum hardware. However, temporal variations in qubit quality metrics affect the performance of a P QC.

With an increasing number of experimental demonstrations carried out on actual quantum hardware and with software being actively developed, this rapidly growing field is poised to have a broad spectrum of real-world applications. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.",10.1088/2058-9565/ab4eb5,"Cambridge Quantum Computing Limited, Cambridge, CB2 1UB, United Kingdom; Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, WC1 E 6BT, United Kingdom","Benedetti M., Cambridge Quantum Computing Limited, Cambridge, CB2 1UB, United Kingdom, Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, WC1 E 6BT, United Kingdom; Lloyd E., Cambridge Quantum Computing Limited, Cambridge, CB2 1UB, United Kingdom; Sack S., Cambridge Quantum Computing Limited, Cambridge, CB2 1UB, United Kingdom; Fiorentini M., Cambridge Quantum Computing Limited, Cambridge, CB2 1UB, United Kingdom",Hybrid quantum-classical systems; Noisy intermediate-scale quantum technology; Quantum computing; Quantum machine learning,Application programs; Quantum computers; Timing circuits; Experimental demonstrations; Expressive power; Generative model; Machine learning models; Quantum Computing; Quantum machines; Quantum technologies; Quantum-classical systems; Machine learning,Institute of Physics Publishing,,,,,Article,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

As the number of devices on chip increases, this task becomes ever more time-consuming, and will be intractable on a large scale without efficient automation. We present measurements on a quantum dot device performed by a machine learning algorithm in real time. The algorithm selects the most informative measurements to perform next by combining information theory with a probabilistic deep-generative model that can generate full-resolution reconstructions from scattered partial measurements. We demonstrate, for two different current map configurations that the algorithm outperforms standard grid scan techniques, reducing the number of measurements required by up to 4 times and the measurement time by 3.7 times. Our contribution goes beyond the use of machine learning for data search and analysis, and instead demonstrates the use of algorithms to automate measurements.

It is expected to be one of the techniques most suited to take advantage of the additional resources provided by near-term quantum computers. Here, we implement a data-driven quantum circuit training algorithm on the canonical Bars-and-Stripes dataset using a quantum-classical hybrid machine. The training proceeds by running parameterized circuits on a trapped ion quantum computer and feeding the results to a classical optimizer. We apply two separate strategies, Particle Swarm and Bayesian optimization to this task. We show that the convergence of the quantum circuit to the target distribution depends critically on both the quantum hardware and classical optimization strategy. Our study represents the first successful training of a high-dimensional universal quantum circuit and highlights the promise and challenges associated with hybrid learning schemes.

The quantum computing community has recently begun to generalize this idea and to look for potential applications. In this work, we derive an adversarial algorithm for the problem of approximating an unknown quantum pure state. Although this could be done on universal quantum computers, the adversarial formulation enables us to execute the algorithm on near-term quantum computers. Two parametrized circuits are optimized in tandem: one tries to approximate the target state, the other tries to distinguish between target and approximated state. Supported by numerical simulations, we show that resilient backpropagation algorithms perform remarkably well in optimizing the two circuits. We use the bipartite entanglement entropy to design an efficient heuristic for the stopping criterion. Our approach may find application in quantum state tomography. © 2019 The Author(s).

As a test case, the ideas are elaborated considering the navigation data of a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV). A concrete QGAN design is proposed to generate fake MAV navigation data. Initially, the adversary is entirely ignorant about the dynamics of the CPS, the strength of the approach from the point of view of the bad guy. A design is also proposed to discriminate between genuine and fake MAV navigation data. The designs combine classical optimization, qubit quantum computing and photonic quantum computing. Using the PennyLane software simulation, they are evaluated over a classical computing platform.

Expanding the portfolio of such techniques, we propose a quantum circuit learning algorithm that can be used to assist the characterization of quantum devices and to train shallow circuits for generative tasks. The procedure leverages quantum hardware capabilities to its fullest extent by using native gates and their qubit connectivity. We demonstrate that our approach can learn an optimal preparation of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, also known as “cat states”. We further demonstrate that our approach can efficiently prepare approximate representations of coherent thermal states, wave functions that encode Boltzmann probabilities in their amplitudes. Finally, complementing proposals to characterize the power or usefulness of near-term quantum devices, such as IBM’s quantum volume, we provide a new hardware-independent metric called the qBAS score. It is based on the performance yield in a specific sampling task on one of the canonical machine learning data sets known as Bars and Stripes. We show how entanglement is a key ingredient in encoding the patterns of this data set; an ideal benchmark for testing hardware starting at four qubits and up.

Motivated by the usefulness of tensor networks for machine learning in the classical context, we propose quantum computing approaches to both discriminative and generative learning, with circuits based on tree and matrix product state tensor networks, that could already have benefits with such near-term devices. The result is a unified framework in which classical and quantum computing can benefit from the same theoretical and algorithmic developments, and the same model can be trained classically then transferred to the quantum setting for additional optimization. Tensor network circuits can also provide qubit-efficient schemes in which, depending on the architecture, the number of physical qubits required scales only logarithmically with, or independently of the input or output data sizes. We demonstrate our proposals with numerical experiments, training a discriminative model to perform handwriting recognition using a hybrid quantum-classical optimization procedure that could be carried out on quantum hardware today, and testing the noise resilience of the trained model. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.",10.1088/2058-9565/aaea94,"University of California, Berkeley, 94720, CA, United States; Center for Computational Quantum Physics, Flatiron Institute, 162 5th Avenue, New York, 10010, NY, United States","Huggins W., University of California, Berkeley, 94720, CA, United States; Patil P., University of California, Berkeley, 94720, CA, United States; Mitchell B., University of California, Berkeley, 94720, CA, United States; Birgitta Whaley K., University of California, Berkeley, 94720, CA, United States; Miles Stoudenmire E., Center for Computational Quantum Physics, Flatiron Institute, 162 5th Avenue, New York, 10010, NY, United States",machine learning; Quantum computing; tensor networks,Character recognition; Learning systems; Quantum optics; Qubits; Tensors; Classical context; Discriminative models; Handwriting recognition; Matrix product state; Noise resiliences; Numerical experiments; Quantum Computing; Unified framework; Machine learning,Institute of Physics Publishing,,,,,Article,All Open Access; Green Open Access

Despite significant effort, there has been a disconnect between most quantum ML proposals, the needs of ML practitioners, and the capabilities of near-term quantum devices to demonstrate quantum enhancement in the near future. In this contribution to the focus collection 'What would you do with 1000 qubits?', we provide concrete examples of intractable ML tasks that could be enhanced with near-term devices. We argue that to reach this target, the focus should be on areas where ML researchers are struggling, such as generative models in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, instead of the popular and more tractable supervised learning techniques. We also highlight the case of classical datasets with potential quantum-like statistical correlations where quantum models could be more suitable. We focus on hybrid quantum-classical approaches and illustrate some of the key challenges we foresee for near-term implementations. Finally, we introduce the quantum-assisted Helmholtz machine (QAHM), an attempt to use near-term quantum devices to tackle high-dimensional datasets of continuous variables. Instead of using quantum computers to assist deep learning, as previous approaches do, the QAHM uses deep learning to extract a low-dimensional binary representation of data, suitable for relatively small quantum processors which can assist the training of an unsupervised generative model. Although we illustrate this concept on a quantum annealer, other quantum platforms could benefit as well from this hybrid quantum-classical framework. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.",10.1088/2058-9565/aab859,"Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab., NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, 94035, CA, United States; USRA Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science, Mountain View, 94043, CA, United States; Qubitera, LLC, Mountain View, 94041, CA, United States; Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom; Cambridge Quantum Computing Limited, Cambridge, CB2 1UB, United Kingdom; SGT Inc., Greenbelt, 20770, MD, United States; Instituto de Matemáticas Aplicadas, Universidad de Cartagena, Bolivar, 130001, Colombia; Exploration Technology Dirct., NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, 94035, CA, United States","Perdomo-Ortiz A., Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab., NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, 94035, CA, United States, USRA Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science, Mountain View, 94043, CA, United States, Qubitera, LLC, Mountain View, 94041, CA, United States, Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom, Cambridge Quantum Computing Limited, Cambridge, CB2 1UB, United Kingdom; Benedetti M., Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab., NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, 94035, CA, United States, USRA Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science, Mountain View, 94043, CA, United States, Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom, Cambridge Quantum Computing Limited, Cambridge, CB2 1UB, United Kingdom; Realpe-Gómez J., Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab., NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, 94035, CA, United States, SGT Inc., Greenbelt, 20770, MD, United States, Instituto de Matemáticas Aplicadas, Universidad de Cartagena, Bolivar, 130001, Colombia; Biswas R., Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab., NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, 94035, CA, United States, Exploration Technology Dirct., NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, 94035, CA, United States",hybrid algorithms; near-term quantum computers; quantum annealing; quantum machine learning; quantum-assisted machine learning; unsupervised generative models; unsupervised learning,Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Quantum optics; Qubits; Supervised learning; Unsupervised learning; Binary representations; Generative model; High dimensional datasets; Hybrid algorithms; Quantum annealing; Quantum machines; Semi- supervised learning; Statistical correlation; Machine learning,Institute of Physics Publishing,,,,,Review,All Open Access; Green Open Access

Simulating the evolution of a state, or even storing its description, rapidly becomes intractable for exact classical algorithms. Recently, machine learning techniques, in the form of restricted Boltzmann machines, have been proposed as a way to efficiently represent certain quantum states with applications in state tomography and ground state estimation. Here, we introduce a practically usable deep architecture for representing and sampling from probability distributions of quantum states. Our representation is based on variational auto-encoders, a type of generative model in the form of a neural network. We show that this model is able to learn efficient representations of states that are easy to simulate classically and can compress states that are not classically tractable. Specifically, we consider the learnability of a class of quantum states introduced by Fefferman and Umans. Such states are provably hard to sample for classical computers, but not for quantum ones, under plausible computational complexity assumptions. The good level of compression achieved for hard states suggests these methods can be suitable for characterizing states of the size expected in first generation quantum hardware. © 2018, The Author(s).",10.1038/s41534-018-0077-z,"Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 3QD, United Kingdom; Department of Materials, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 3PH, United Kingdom; Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, WC1E 6EA, United Kingdom; DAMTP, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB3 0WA, United Kingdom; Institute for Theoretical Physics, ETH Zürich, Zürich, 8093, Switzerland; Center for Computational Quantum Physics, Flatiron Institute, New York, 10010, United States; Institute of Natural Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China","Rocchetto A., Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 3QD, United Kingdom, Department of Materials, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 3PH, United Kingdom, Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, WC1E 6EA, United Kingdom; Grant E., Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, WC1E 6EA, United Kingdom; Strelchuk S., DAMTP, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB3 0WA, United Kingdom; Carleo G., Institute for Theoretical Physics, ETH Zürich, Zürich, 8093, Switzerland, Center for Computational Quantum Physics, Flatiron Institute, New York, 10010, United States; Severini S., Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, WC1E 6EA, United Kingdom, Institute of Natural Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China",,Ground state; Learning systems; Probability distributions; Quantum optics; Computational resources; Deep architectures; Generative model; Machine learning techniques; Many-body quantum systems; Quantum distribution; Restricted boltzmann machine; State tomography; Quantum efficiency,Nature Partner Journals,,,,,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

A significant school of thought regarding artificial intelligence is based on generative models. Here, we propose a general quantum algorithm for machine learning based on a quantum generative model. We prove that our proposed model is more capable of representing probability distributions compared with classical generative models and has exponential speedup in learning and inference at least for some instances if a quantum computer cannot be efficiently simulated classically. Our result opens a new direction for quantum machine learning and offers a remarkable example where a quantum algorithm shows exponential improvement over classical algorithms in an important application field.

In this work, we introduce the quantum-assisted Helmholtz machine:a hybrid quantum-classical framework with the potential of tackling high-dimensional real-world machine learning datasets on continuous variables. Instead of using quantum computers only to assist deep learning, as previous approaches have suggested, we use deep learning to extract a low-dimensional binary representation of data, suitable for processing on relatively small quantum computers. Then, the quantum hardware and deep learning architecture work together to train an unsupervised generative model.

Here we provide methods of training quantum Boltzmann machines. Our work generalizes existing methods and provides additional approaches for training quantum neural networks that compare favorably to existing methods. We further demonstrate that quantum Boltzmann machines enable a form of partial quantum state tomography that further provides a generative model for the input quantum state. Classical Boltzmann machines are incapable of this. This verifies the long-conjectured connection between tomography and quantum machine learning.

There is increasing interest in the potential advantages of using quantum computing technologies as sampling engines to speed up these tasks or to make them more effective. However, some pressing challenges in state-of-the-art quantum annealers have to be overcome before we can assess their actual performance. The sparse connectivity, resulting from the local interaction between quantum bits in physical hardware implementations, is considered the most severe limitation to the quality of constructing powerful generative unsupervised machine-learning models. Here, we use embedding techniques to add redundancy to data sets, allowing us to increase the modeling capacity of quantum annealers. We illustrate our findings by training hardware-embedded graphical models on a binarized data set of handwritten digits and two synthetic data sets in experiments with up to 940 quantum bits. Our model can be trained in quantum hardware without full knowledge of the effective parameters specifying the corresponding quantum Gibbs-like distribution; therefore, this approach avoids the need to infer the effective temperature at each iteration, speeding up learning; it also mitigates the effect of noise in the control parameters, making it robust to deviations from the reference Gibbs distribution.

Conceptual skills are being enhanced through the use of interactive mapping techniques connected to online resources. The ability to see connections with data and relate it to trends analysis is a key aspect in utilizing Big Data. Coupled with the rise of Big Data is also the development of faster computing systems which can collate and summarize data queries initiated by the enduser. The age of quantum computers whereby searching techniques will be accelerated beyond current abilities of the processing speeds of traditional digital processors will necessitate different ways to display information and analyze it. Natural language and semantic search strategies, search engine advancements and AI developments are introducing newer approaches to data analysis. By using both search techniques formulated by humans and combining them with results obtained from machine assisted learning a new era of information access has evolved. Finding information using newer cognitive based modeling systems to help retrieve information as well as understanding the growth of data will be outlined. Visual demonstrations of new information modeling systems will be discussed and the implications of accessing data for the eventual solutions to complex problems will also be discussed. The rate of change in knowledge accumulation necessitates that search strategies be fluid and generative in their design rather than static or sequential. Knowledge management also needs to be integrated with a dynamic structure with search strategy designs, which can constantly utilize newer forms of data analysis. The preparation and planning for installing a progressive knowledge based management and acquisition system in educational institutions needs to be deployed sooner rather than later so as to better prepare the next generation of Thai students entering the newly formed ASAEN community.
